<div class="dropleft"><img class="purple" style="float: left; margin: 5px" src="images/people/linder1.jpg"  height=250 width=220 border=2 alt="Max Linder" title="Max Linder">
<div class="dropdown-content2"></div></div>
During 1906 Linder continued to divide his time between the theatre and the cinema. On the stage, he appeared as an <i>abbé<i> 
in the Napoleonic drama by Antoine, Marquis de Castellane <i>Pour la patrie</i> at the théâtre de l'Ambigu-Comique, apparently a 
disastrous flop and several suppoting roles at the same theatre an later at the théâatre des Variétés, where he was under contract 
and would stay for another three years.
<br><br>
Six Max Linder films are known for 1906. <i>Les Étudiants de Paris</i> was seemingly not directed like his first film for Pathé, 
by Louis Gasnier, but by the otherwise completely unknown Harry Ray and written by André Heuzé. It is however in much the same line 
as the Gasnier film and <a href="linder05.html">as the earlier film made for Théophile Pathé</a>, with Linder playing a student, the 
son of a provinvial notary, having a high time in the Latin quarter in Paris until the parents decide to pay a surprise visit. In 
the four=minute comedy <i>Julot va dans le monde</i> - he was not of course yet known as "Max", he again plays an <i>ingenu</i>, 
this time making his awkward <i>entrée</i> into fine society, ridiculous in his extravagant new clothes. 
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Ce pauvre Julot ! c’est certainement la première fois qu’il va dans le monde, car après beaucoup de préparatifs, il arrive tout endimanché 
de façon grotesque. Il se présente très maladroitement et, après avoir commis maladresses sur maladresses, se fait chasser honteusement par 
le maître de maison. 
</blockquote>

Charles Huart, <i>Lucien de Rubempré</i>, engraving after Honoré de Balzac, <i>Illusions perdues</i> (12837-1843)<div class="dropdown-content"></div></div>
The Linder films of this period seem almost like a seialization of the Paris adventures of the young Lucien in Honoré de Balzac's <i>Illusions 
perdues</i> of 1837-1843 but allow us to appreciate how quintessentially French these first incarnations of a Linder persona, if not <b>the</b> 
Linder persona, already are and how precisely, like Balzac's novel, they already hone in on the anxious fringes of the French bourgeoisie. 
<i>La Puce gênante</i> (<i>The Troublesome Flea</i>) is exactly what one might suppose from the title, but once again in a situation of social 
angst, a young man come a-courting. 
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Chez Madame X., la soirée bat son plein. Les invités rivalisent d’amabilités auprès des dames, tout le monde semble réjoui. Seul un jeune 
homme aspirant à la main de l’héritière garde un visage morose, à cause d’une puce qui le dévore. Profitant de ce qu’il est un instant seul 
il retire son pantalon et se précipite au balcon pour l’y secouer. Mais un faux mouvement fait tomber le vêtement dans la rue. Surpris en 
caleçon, il provoque un tel scandale qu’il est chassé sans merci.

The five-minute film <i>Le Pendu</i> (<i>Attempted Suicide</i> or <i>The Man Who Hanged Himself</i>) which appeared on 14 December 
1906 probably was directed by Gasnier and is one of the most elaborate films made by Linder in the year and it is possibly his 
awareness that it marked a clear advance in his career that caused him to remake it in a longer version in 1914. The film, about 
a young Romeo who, having been refused the hand of his girl by her father, fakes a suicide, is also notable for the fact that it 
is the first (or the first we know of) in which Max wears what would become his trademark top hat and tails, which would reeappear 
in <i>Débuts d'un patineur</i> in 1907. The film is based on a well-known song of 1880 by poet and <i>chansonnier</i> Maurice Mac 
Nab (1858-1889) whose songs had been published in a collected edition in 1891 as <i>Poèmes incongrus</i> by the Éditions Léon Vanel 
(who also famously publishd the poet Verlaine) and this song was recorded for Pathé in 1906 by by music-hall artist André Maréchal 
<i>dit</i> Maréchal de l'Eldorado. So in France this film was played as a kind of musical comedy. The "hanging" accomplished, the 
unhurried rescue that follows the discovery of the body was accompanied by the voice of Maréchal.

Le Pendu de Mac Nab

Un garçon venait de se pendre
Dans la forêt de Saint Germain
Pour une fillette au coeur tendre
Dont on lui refusait la main

Un passant, le coeur plein d'alarme,
En voyant qu'il soufflait encor'
Dit "Allons chercher les gendarmes,
Peut-être bien qu'il n'est pas mort&nbsp;!"

Le brigadier sans perdre haleine
Enfourcha son grand cheval blanc.
Arrivé chez le capitaine,
Il conta la chose en tremblant

Un jeune homme vient de se pendre
A son âge quel triste sort.
Faut-il qu'on aille le dépendre&nbsp;?
Peut-être bien qu'il n'est pas mort.

L'officier, frisant sa moustache,
Se redresse et répond soudain&nbsp;:
"Vraiment, c'est une noble tâche
Que de soulager son prochain

Cependant je n'y puis rien faire,
Ce n'est pas de notre ressort.
Courez-donc chez le Commissaire

Descendit, c'était son devoir.
D'un coup d'oeil embrassant l'espace,

The hanged man by Mac Nab
sung by Maréchal
<br><br>
A young man has just hanged himself
In the forest of Saint Germain
Desperate for a tender lass
Whose hand he had been refused.
<br>
An alarmed passer-by,
Seeing that he was still breathing,
Said "Let us send for the gendarmes,
Perhaps the man is still alive"
<br>
The constable, not losing breath
Mounted his tall white horse
And went riding to the Captain's
To report with tremulous voice
<br>
A young man has just hanged himself
At his age, what a sorry fate
Shall we go and take him down?
Perhaps the man is still alive
<br>
The Captain, twirling his moustache
Stood up and all of a sudden
Replied: It is a noble deed
To relieve your neighbour's pain.
<br>
However, I can do nothing
This is not in our jurisdiction.
You should run to the Commissaire's
The hanged man may still be living.
<br>
The Commissaire came down the square,
For he was duty-bound.
And quickly looking around him,
He shouted with all his might:
<br>
A young man has just hanged himself
Countrymen get up and run fast
Let us take there what is needed.
Perhaps the man is still alive
<br
All his friends thought: What a strange thing
To take his own life that way!
The tender lass screamed crazily:
I also want to die!
<br>
But the parents, Mercy on them!
Said as a funeral oration:
We can always share out the rope
T'will bring good luck to the household!

We know next to nothing of the singer André Maréchal ("Maréchal of the Eldorado, although recordings survive. He was a baritone 
(not to be confused with Belgian tenor Alphonse Maréchal). He often sang with Charlus, who was the head of Pathé's recording department. 
Pathé produced a series of «&nbsp;scènes ciné-phonographiques&nbsp;» with synchronisd sound (the equivalent of the better known 
Gaumont «&nbsp;phonoscènes&nbsp;». The 1904 Pathé catalogue printed a letter from Maréchal in which he expressed his gratitude 
(a shade obsequiously) for the work he had done with Pathé.

Maréchal singing the Mac Nab song was also available as a separate two-minute film, also called <i>Le Pendu</i> but it was also 
clearly used to accompany the Linder film, at least at the Pathé cinema in Paris, and, by the sound of it, with Maréchal himself 
present in person. The film was released on the 14 December and a review in <i>Le Journal</i> on 17 December describes how the 
«&nbsp;image&nbsp;» represents a young man going off to the forest to hang himself (the story of the Linder film) while <i>une 
voix gouailleuse</i> ("a mocking voice") of «&nbsp;un artiste&nbsp;» (evidently Maréchal) accompanies the subsequent events as 
they unfold. Evidently, with the recording separately available, a similar effect could be obtained without his presence in provincial 
cinemas. Presumably the audience were encouraged to sing along. It must all have made for a very enjoyable evening. S the review 
in <i>Le Journal</i> puts it: «&nbsp;Et puis..et puis..il faut aller voir vous-même, car il y a des choses qui ne se racontent pas&nbsp;» 
("And then..and then...you must go and see it for yourselves, for there are things that cannot be described").
<br><br>
None of this seems to have been available to the US audience when the film appeared there on 19 January 1907. <i>Variety</i> saw 
it rather as a satire (which it also is) and reviewed it favourably:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
"Attempted Suicide" is a travesty on the "red tape" of the French police service; at least the characters seem French and the uniforms 
worn are of that nation. A young man disappointed in love wanders to the woods, where he hangs himself to the limb of a tree. A boy 
discovering him, runs in alarm to tell the gardener, who is conveniently at hand; the gardener views the death struggles, but, 
having a scythe in his hand, dares not cut the rope without the presence of an officer and hurries after one. A mounted policeman 
is secured, who rides up, looks at the hanging person and returns to the station house to report, without attempting to retrieve 
the young man from his sure death position. The policeman with his sergeant returns once more, watches the last feeble struggles and, 
ignoring the fate about to arrive, ride off to inform the young fellow's father. That personage, while alarmed, declines to hasten 
until his necktie and scarf have been properly adjusted, when all run to the woods, and the presumed suicide (by this time) is laid 
upon the ground. Upon his sweetheart arriving he embraces her madly, having been playing "possum," which may be detected by the 
through seeing a hook attached to the end of the rope in his coat. This relieves what would be otherwise a gruesome sight, and for 
real pure fun, with the burlesque on the idiotic police system always to the fore, "Attempted Suicide" will be difficult to beat.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
The review is inaccurate in certain respects. The hanged man is not discovered by a gardener carrying a scythe but by a boy carrying 
a trowel; he is digging for truffles. The "personage" adjusting his sash before going to the rescue is not the young man's father 
but the <i>commissaire</i> (what nowadays would be the <i>maire</i>). The word has travelled all the way up the administrative hierarchy 
in exemplary French fashion. And the audience is not really suposed to notice that "hook".

There is a certain irony here because the satire of the police that the US review praises was precisely the element that Linder 
would remove in the 15-minute 1914 version, written and directed by himself, where the policeman (this time a <i>comissaire</i>) 
is atually sympathetic towards Max and even tries (unsuccessfully) to intercede on his behalf with the father. Evidently in July 
1914, on the eve of war, such satire of the police was less acceptable. In the later version, Max has to hang himself a second 
time - from the chandelier - before the father is prepared to consider. The important change in the second film, as with all 
remakes Max made at this time, is that the central character is now clearly "Max" whereas in the 1906 version it is still just 
the ingenuous young man that Max had been playing in al these early films, and the reason for the father's refusal is specifically 
on account of his being an «&nbsp;artiste cinématographique&nbsp;». This was not yet how Linder saw himself in 1906, still hoping 
for a career in the theatre. It was in this year that he made his third and last application to the Paris Conservatory, yet again 
rejected. The effect of that rejection would be clearly seen in 1907.

<br><br>
Another version of <i>Le Pendu</i> was made at aound the same time by Alice Guy at Gaumont, still based on the Mac Nab poem but 
with the story changed so that, rather than disappointed in love, the young man is exasperated by his mother-in-law who keeps 
playing her phonograph too loudly and his scolding wife. This was, <a href="french06.html#gaum">as we have seen</a>, a period 
when a kind of friendly competition existed between the two French companies, particularly between the principal writers, André 
Heuzé for Pathé (who very probably wrote this film for Gasnier) and Louis Feuillade and Roméo Bosetti (one or other of whom almost 
certainly wrote the Gaumont version for Guy). Unlike the Pathé version, there seems to have been no accompanying synchronised 
recording, surprisingly perhaps at a time when Guy was very actively making «&nbsp;phonoscènes&nbsp;», but there may have been 
problems with copyright with regard to the song that did not as yet exist with regard to films. The song was however well known 
and the Gaumont film involves the same running of the gamut of the village hierarchy before the rescue party all eventually gather 
in the forest to cut down the hanged man (photographing him first, however, in the Gaumont version) in a scene practically identical 
to that in the Pathé film. It is not however a bicycle pump that revives the hanged man but the malevolent mother-in-law winding 
up her phonograph once more.

The Pathé version may also have been issued in a variant where Linder is revived with holy water rather than a bicycle pump. A 
film is recorded in an Austrian archive, shown apparently in Vienna in 1913, where, according to the description in censorship records, 
«&nbps;der anscheinend tote Clown&nbsp;» (the seemingly dead "clown", presumably here simply meaning comedian) «&nbsp;mit Wiehwasser 
bespringst wird&nbsp;» (is sprinkled with holy water). The archived film is the same length as the original and this ending could 
have been shot later (the original pumping scene seeming too absurd) and the rather morbid element of religious jiggery-pokery 
subsitituted; in which case it may have been another change incorporated in Linder's own longer lost 1914 version of the film. 
The existing catalogue description of the 1914 film does ot explain how Max is "revived" (a use of "holy watr" is more likely 
to have attracted the attention of the censor) and the Austrian film is known under a later generic title («&nbsp;Max Linder 
als Regisseur im Kino&nbsp;»), suggesting Linder himself was responsible for it. Given Linder's tendency to reuse films as part 
of live spectacles, this kind of piecemeal revision of films does not seem altogether improbable.
<br><br>
a name="pitou"></a>
If Linder was still far off being the famous "Max" of later years in 1906, there is a possibility that he acted in a linked series 
of three films in 1906-1908 in the character of Pitou, a name typically used for a soldier. The first Pitou film, with neither director 
of actor credited, appeared in May 1906 and was entitled <i>Pitou amoureux</i>. The catalogue description is as follows:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Ces différentes scènes, dignes de Courteline, nous montrent les tribulations de Pitou, amoureux de la cuisinière de son capitaine. 
Obligé de se cacher dans une caisse à charbon, il en sort dans un piteux état, d’abord pour recevoir une verte semonce de son supérieur, 
ensuite pour aller à la salle de police. 
</blockquote>
<br><br>
The reference to Courteline, virtually <i>de rigueur</i> for such barrack-rooom comedies, refers to Georges Moinaux <i>dit> Georges 
Courteline (1858-1929), author of the classic 1886 barrack-room stories <Les Gaietés de l'escadron</i> and a vaudeville act featuring 
one of the many exponents of the «&nbsp;comique troupier&nbsp;» genre, Dranem, had already been filmed by Pathé <a href="int01cs.html>in 
as early as 1901. This not at all a typical Linder part, even in the early stage of his career, but he had played a similar <i>troupier/i> 
role on the stage (Poplard in the stage adapatation of JUles Mary's <i>feuilleton</i>, <i>Le Régiment</i>in 1905 and Linder most certainly 
played Pitou in a second film in 1907 while there was a third «&nbsp;Pitou&nbsp;» film in 1908 where Pitou is a colonel's batman (<i>ordonnance</i>.

A similar film featurng a colonel and his batman, this time named Polyte, the three-minute <i>La Bicyclette du colonel</i>, appeared 
sometime towards the very end of 1906.

Polyte, l’ordonnance, va et vient dans la cour, de son pas militaire, lourd et balancé comme la marche des oies. Céleste apparaît 
à la porte de la cuisine. Elle aperçoit la bicyclette du colonel et vivement, aidée de Polyte, enjambe le cadre de la machine. Et 
les voilà tous deux, lancés à travers les allées, zigzaguant, fauchant les fleurs des parterres, foulant l’herbe des pelouses, renversant 
les plantes rares de Madame, dévastant tout sur leur passage, gris comme de jeunes chevaux qu’on vient de mettre à l’herbe. Ah&nbsp;! 
la bonne partie. Mais quelle débandade quand la tête effarée du colonel leur apparaît au tournant d’une allée tandis que Madame, du côté 
opposé, ayant découvert les dégâts, attrape et secoue énergiquement Céleste pleurante et décoiffée. Quelle sauce, mes amis&nbsp;!

Once again it is not at all the sort of part Linder normally played (although he would play a maid's beau in <i>Lèvres collées</i> 
in 1907) and an uncouth valet in <i>Une bonne pour Monsieur, un domestique pour Madame</i> in 1910) and a later (1910?) and longer 
(seven minutes) film of Max cycling to disaster supposedly exists ina German archive under the title <i>Max Linder Der galante 
Radfahrer</i>.
<br><br>
Another film oif 1906 in whcih Linder may have appeared is Charles Lucien Lépine's four-minute comedy <i>Cocher&nbsp;! À l’heure</i>
which seemingly appeared towards the end of the year.

<blockquote>
Le cheval trottine d’un train si doux qu’il semble danser sur place. Le voyageur, impatienté, agite si fort ses bras qu’il semble accomplir 
avec eux plus de besogne que Cocotte avec ses jambes, cependant que le cocher, toujours impassible, fume sa pipe en claquant mollement son 
fouet. Ouf&nbsp;! il fait chaud. Insensible aux protestations indignées qui s’élèvent du fond de la voiture, il descend de son siège, s’installe 
à la terrasse d’un café. Puis, légèrement éméché, notre cocher fait subir à son &nbsp;bourgeois&nbsp;» un martyr aussi long que varié, 
tant et si bien que le bourgeois obtient de son tyran de conduire lui-même. Il arrive enfin à destination, en gare, juste pour voir le 
train démarrer, partir et filer sans lui.

Whether or not Linder played the discomfited passenger in this film, he very certainly played in a variant on the film, <i>Cocher&nbsp;! 
à l'Olympia</i> which was shown at the théâtre de l'Olympia in the boulevard des Capucines as part of their «&nbsp;Grand Revue&nbsp;» 
<a href=linder10.html#olympia">in April 1910</a>. Linder appeared live on the telephone (acording to one account) and on screen 
"hurrying from his house in a great state of excitement, fearing he will be late for the theatre" (according to another) but both 
accounts agree on the fact that what follows is «&nbsp;une poursuite abracadabrante&nbsp;...à travers les rues, les boulevards et 
les places de Paris, pour s'achever à la porte de l'Olympia&nbsp;». At which point Linder himself (re)appeared on stage, "tattered 
and torn after his adventureous trip."  THe &nbsp;bourgeois&nbsp;» sufering at the hands of the coachman is, in both films, an  
absolutely typical Linder role.
