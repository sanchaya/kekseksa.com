<a name="french"></a><h3>French Cinema</h3>
<a name="pathe"></a><h4>Pathé</h4>
<p>
<br><br>
For Ferdinand Zecca, now firmly ensconced as the man in overall charge of Pathé production, 1905 was a year of furious activity 
aimed at breathing new life into the Pathé series «&nbsp;scènes dramatiques et réalistes&nbsp;» which had <a href="french03.html#pathe">first 
first begun to appear, very possibly at Zecca's suggestion, in 1903 but would come to play a central role in the development of 
the Pathé repertoire in 1905-1906.
<br><br>
The four-minute <i>L'Honneur d'un père</i>, which appeared in spring-summer 1905,is a straightforward tale of crime and revenge.

<blockquote>
La fille du garde-chasse reçoit une lettre du jeune homme du château lui assignant un rendez-vous. Intriguée et tout en se demandant 
ce qu’il peut bien lui vouloir elle se rend néanmoins à l’endroit désigné, sur le pont. Elle trouve le jeune homme qui lui déclare 
aussitôt son amour&nbsp;; la jeune fille surprise autant qu’inquiète, regrette sa légèreté et veut fuir, mais le jeune homme la 
saisit et cherche à l’embrasser de force. Elle oppose une vive résistance si bien que lui, ne se contenant plus, l’a prise par 
le cou et dans un accès de rage folle a serré tellement fort qu’elle tombe inerte sur la route. Se rendant compte de son épouvantable 
forfait, il ne songe plus qu’à faire disparaître les traces de son crime et, ramassant le cadavre, il le jette par-dessus le parapet. 
Un gamin jouant sur le bord de la rivière a aperçu le corps que le courant a jeté sur la pointe de l’île&nbsp;; il court aussitôt 
prévenir les gens de la ferme voisine. Ceux-ci retirent la jeune fille de l’eau et se servant d’une barrière comme civière, la portent 
chez son père. Le garde-chasse, au comble de la douleur, a cependant aperçu une lettre émergeant du corsage de la jeune fille&nbsp;; 
après en avoir pris connaissance, il comprend tout et ne songe plus qu’à se venger. Il rentre chez lui prendre un fusil et part comme 
un fou. Il arrive à l’entrée du bois et voyant le meurtrier déjà poursuivi par la police, il s’embusque derrière un arbre et lorsque 
le jeune homme passe à la portée, il l’abat d’un coup de feu&nbsp;; puis remettant son fusil il se constitue prisonnier.

The whole film can be watched on on the <a href="http://filmographie.fondation-jeromeseydoux-pathe.com/5710-honneur-d-un-pere-l?depuisindex=auteurs&idauteur=1270">Jerôme

<br><br>
A much more important Zecca film that appeared during the summer was the ten-minute <i>Au pays noir</i> (<i>Tragedy in a Coal Mine</i>), 
an account of a mining disaster, which seems to have been one of the first films for which a set of publicity postcrads were produced, 
something that became quite standard practice for major films in the series. Coal-mining and mine diasters were, as in the case of 
alcoholism and its ravages, a subject to which Zecca had already <a href="french02.html#pathe">devoted one film in 1902</a> and would 
devote another later this same year (<a href="#alctub">see below</a>, a theme especially assocaited with naturalism. Just as Zola's 
1876 novel <i>L'Assommoir</i> provided a text of reference for the subject of alcoholism, so his 1885 novel <i>Germinal</i> was 
a text of reference for the subject of coal-mining and mining disasters. As the film is in the nature of a "disaster film", I discuss 
it at more length <a href="int05dis.html">elsewhere</a>.
<br><br>
The three-minute <i>Le Remords</i>, produced in the autumn (it was shown in London in September), is a straightforward tale of 
crime and (psychological) punishment

The pictures, posts, doors, and all about the house seem to be apparitions of his old master. Finally he falls dead on the spot

More substantial entries in the series later in the year were the ten-minute <i>Les Apaches de Paris</i> (shown in Britain in 
November) and its sequel <i>Au bagne</i> which <a href="int05kri.html">I discuss fully elsewhere</a> and the seven-minute <i>L'Alcool 
engendre la tuberculose</i> (shown in Britain as <i>Alcohol, the Cause of Consumption</i> and in the US as <i>Alcohol and its 
Victims</i> in December). The danger of alcoholism was a key theme of naturalist literature and drama, if only because of the 
huge influence of Émile Zola's 1876 novel <i>L'Assommoir</i>, which the author himself had described, without false modesty, as 
«&nbso;le premier roman sur le peuple, qui ne mente pas et qui ait l'odeur du peuple&nbsp;» (the first novel about the people 
which does not lie and has the smell of the people). The Zola novel, which contained an unremitting picture of the ravages of 
alcoholism, had been adapted as a play as early as 1879 by William Busnach and Octave Gastineau, with the aid of Zola himself; 
Pathé had <a href="french00.html#pathe">already produced a film in about 1899-1900</a>, representing the most famous - and most 
sensational - scene from the book, a scene that had contributed very largely to the success of the play. the catfight in the laundry 
or «&nbspscène du lavoir&nbsp;», a film that was possibly the work of Gaston Breteau, Zecca had himelf already made <a href="french02.html#pathe">a 
six-minute film-version entitled <i>Les Victimes de l’alcoolisme</i> in 1902</a>, very clearly influenced by the Zola novel 
and Albert Capellani would adapt the novel again for Pathé <a href="french08.html#pathe">in 1908</a>. This film of 1905 covers 
very similar ground:

Au régiment, un homme faible de caractère se laisse facilement entraîner à contracter de mauvaises habitudes. C’est là que le personnage

profite de ses faiblesses en excitant son faux amour-propre, il descend la pente fatale. Dans une rixe, le malheureux tue son tentateur 
en lui cassant une bouteille sur le crâne puis il devient fou furieux&nbsp;; on le ligote, on l’emporte et il va mourir, alcoolique 
invétéré dans le cabanon des fous, tandis que sa malheureuse femme, véritable martyre, assiste à l’agonie et à la mort de sa petite 
fille qu’emporte la terrible tuberculose.

The film seems to have had a very significant impact. It  was described by the London journal <i>The Era</i> on 6 January 1906 
as "the finest Temperance Lecture ever put before the Public." A Havana newspaper on 31 July 1906 considered it to be "a dramatic 
socio-medical study of transcendant moral importance". The Spanish journal <i>El Diario de Tortosa</i> on 15 February 1906 went 
even further and compared the film to the plays of Ibsen and had no doubt of it pedagogic importance, on which it lavishes the 
most fulsome praise. I quote it at length (accompanied by my own rather inadequate tranlsation) as it is an excellent illustration 
of how significant the power of the cinema was considered to be in this regard:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Pero lo que estimamos como verdadero clou del espectáculo es, la para nosotros admirable película «&nbsp;El alcohol engendra la tuberculosis&nbsp;» 
intenso drama, cuya síntesis no vive y estalla entre espasmos de amores contrariados ni honras mancilladas, sino á la manera de Ibsen, frívolo al 
parecer cuando empieza, prosigue sutil, acerado y tenaz hasta el fin, dejando el ánimo augustiado y el pensamiento en hondas reflexiones.
<br><br>
Sin duda el artista que ha producido tan hermosa película, no se propuso tan solo desarrollar un tema más con que entretener y emocionar al público, 
sino que fué más allá su finalidad, poniendo de relieve con trazos magistrales los estragos que el abuso del alcohol produce en el individuo, que cegado 
por él, olvida sus deberes, hiere y mata y atosigado por sus vapores, muere en el manicomio entre convulsiones dolorosas, dejando por triste herencia 
á sus pequeños el raquitismo que los aniquila y la tuberculosis que los consume…
<br><br>
Francia, práctica en pedagogías, atiende á la juventud con enseñanzas gráficas y puebla al caso sus colegios é institutos, de cuadros 
que afean el vicio de la bebida y de otros tantos que degradan al hombre, y obtiene por éste sencillo medio escelente resultado, porque 
el niño graba más en su memoria lo que sus ojos vieron que el prudente consejo ó sabia lección que oyera de sus profesores.
<br><br>
¿Sería desacertado esperar, que los profesores de ésta ciudad, á falta de otros medios plásticos, aprovecharan la ocasión para esta enseñanza, 
ó que el Ayuntamiento acudiera con una pequeña subvención, para el mismo fin?
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
an intense drama, whose climax explodes amid scenes of unhealthy amours and tainted honour, but in the manner of Ibsen, frivolous 
apparently when it begins, it continues subtle, steely and tenacious until the end, remaining august in spirit and leaving a mood 
of deep reflection.
<br><br>
Undoubtedly the artist who has produced such a beautiful film, did not set out just to provide one more theme to entertain and 
excite the public, but went beyond this purpose, highlighting with masterful strokes the ravages that alcohol abuse produces in 
the individual, who, blinded by it, forgets his duties, wounds and kills and, poisoned by the its toxic efflusion, dies in the 
asylum subject to painful convulsions, leaving as sad inheritance to his children the rickets that annihilates them and the tuberculosis 
that consumes them ...
<br><br>
France, practised in pedagogy, offers graphic examples to young people both in its colleges and institutes and here in these pictures 
showing the effects of the vice of drinking and other things that degrade man achieves its result by this simple and excellent 
means because a child records better in his memory what the eyes sees than any prudent advice or wise lesson he may have heard 
from his teachers.
<br><br>
Would it not be wise to expect the teachers of this city, in the absence of other suitable media, to take advantage of the opportunity 
for teaching that this represents, or for the munispal authorities to come up with a small grant for the purpose?

<br><br>
For this, as for so much material that I use on this site, I am enormously indebted to the hugely important work carried out by <a href="https://www.grimh.org/index.php?lang=fr">the 
grimh (Groupe de refléxion sur l'image dans le monde hispanique)</a> in making fully available to the public a mass of facinating 
material that would otherwise have lain gathering dust in archives and libraries.
<br><br> 
a psychological thriller reminiscent of Fedor Dostoievski's 1866 novel <i>Prestuplenie i nakazanie</i> (<i>Crime 
and Punishment</i>) and was in fact plagiarised from Maurice Landay's hugely succcessful play <i>La Loi du pardon</i> (1905) which 
ran for 300 performances at the Théâtre du peuple. The play claimed in its publicity to be inspired by the work of «&nbsp'le bon 
juge&nbsp;», <a href="french06.html#magnaud">Paul Magnaud</a>, who had become famous for his controversial humanitarian judgements 
at the tribunal de Château-Thierry in the Aisne in Picardy and who, in 1900, had presented a pretition to the French parliament 
entitled «&nbsp;La Loi du pardon&nbsp;» in 1899 in favour of a reform of the law that would incorporate the principle of «&nbsp;l’état 
de nécessité&nbsp;» (the state of need) as an attenuating circumstance for crime. In practice Landay's play simply uses Magnaud's 
ideas as a starting-point and an excuse for a psychological thriller adopts a moral position quite different from, and even arguably 
hostile to that of Magnaud. The culprit certainly escapes judgement by a court but only to suffer, like Dostoievski's Raskalnikov, 
from terrible torments of conscience.
<br><br>
Georges Hatot, who despised Zecca for his lack of culture - the same thing he so admired in his own collaborators, Gaston Breteau 
and later Victorin Jasset - claimed, years later, that Zecca was in the habit of plagiarising theatre-plays in this way for the 
plots of his films. In this case, again according to Hatot, the playwright Maurice Landay even threatened to sue, one of many such 
disputes in which Pathé frères was involved at this time, an irritant that would contribute significantly to <a href="french07.html#pathe">Pathé's 
1907 decision</a> to switch to a system of renting films which was associated with an important reflection on the whole question 
of the copyright of films by Pathé's legal consultant, Edmond Benoît-Lévy.
<br><br>
<div class="dropright"><img src="images/people/capellani.jpg" height=280 width=240 border=2 alt="Albert Capellani" title="Albert Capellani">

The most important new director to emerge at Pathé in 1905 was Albert Capellani. Capellani (1874-1931) had been for a year administrator 
of the Alhambra music-hall (1904-1905) before joining the company but his presence theer would very much second the attempts of 
Ferdinand Zecca to increase both the level of seriousness in Pathé dramas and to move them towards a greater realism, consonant 
with the pressure from the "art film" movement and the growing influence of the naturalist movement in France. 
<br><br>
The gulf between town and country was nothing new at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth; it 
had existed, in pretty much identical fashion, since at least early modern times and is as old as the growth of an urban population 
no longer tied to the rules and routines of rural life. It is noticeable that for an essentially urban cinema-going public rather 
different riles apply to the two milieux. While any form of vagabondage, let alone crime, tended to be regarded severely in an urban 
context and the police and authorities, if occasionaly satirised, tended on the whole to be upheld, it was perfectly acceptale to 
mock and deride the stupidty and the authorities (and the two were often close to being synonyms) in the country and be unashamedly 
tolerant of rural delinquency (scrumping, poaching and the like). Respect for property was a less stable value for the urban bourgeoisie 
where the country was concerned; there they themselves felt capable of being a shade delinquent when on holiday.

<br><br>
Lucien Nonguet's eight-minute <i>Les Petits vagabonds</i>, released in autumn 1905 as part of the same series, is a typical case 
of young rural delinquents being regarded to some extent as healthy pranksters while the farmer and the <i>pandores</i> ("cops") 
who go in their pursuit are accorded only grudging respect and little sympathy. There is nothing strange about this. It is the 
standard viewpoint of an urban middle-class, for whom the country is a place where they spend their leisure-time. One notes, for 
instance, in the British review below the talk of "lovely country rich with magnificent scenery", a curiously discurssive manner 
of describing a police chase that one would hardly encounter in a review of a film in an urban setting. Of course I myself and 
most the people reading this will tend to share a similar viewpoint because it is the class to which I and they also belong. Note 
also, however, that here the film is qualified intended as "a realistic drama" not a comedy and the delinquency involved is not 
really so innocent or excusable. Hence there must be one culprit, albeit, in terms of natural justice, the wrong one. Naturalism 
demands...

A very interesting, and rather different, entry in the series late in the year was the anonymous <i>Au pays des glaces</i>, a tale 
of an artic exploration that goes badly wrong, but, since this film is on the juncture of seeveral genres (disaster films, films of 
arctic exploration), I discuss it more fully <a href="int05wsm.html">elsewhere</a>.

Deux petits vagabonds se sont introduits dans un poulailler et le mettent à sac, enlevant œufs, poulets et lapins. Les paysans 
ne tardent pas à s’apercevoir du larcin et se mettent à leur poursuite. Nos deux drôles, avec l’inconscience de leur âge, se 
disposent à faire cuire les œufs trop près d’une meule de paille qu’ils mettent en feu. Voyant alors la conséquence de leur 
étourderie, ils ne songent plus qu’à fuir. Tandis que les pompiers prévenus accourent pour éteindre ce commencement d’incendie, 
les paysans qui ont été chercher les gendarmes tâchent de rattraper les deux gamins ; ils sont bientôt sur leurs traces. Mais ceux-ci, 
plus jeunes et plus agiles, vont toujours de l’avant, laissant loin derrière les gens pendus à leurs trousses. Néanmoins, arrivés 
à une mare, l’un des deux se jette à l’eau et gagne l’autre rive à la nage. Le plus petit qui ne peut suivre son aîné est bientôt 
rejoint et saisi par les gendarmes. Il paiera pour les deux voilà tout et il est emmené, menottes aux poignets, par deux gendarmes 
à cheval qui le conduisent à la prison de la ville. L’aîné qui a pu gagner la route en se dissimulant dans les broussailles, tente 
un coup hardi en enlevant son petit frère qu’il emporte dans le taillis, tandis que nos braves pandores continuent leur chemin, 
heureux du devoir accompli, sans s’apercevoir que leur petit prisonnier a disparu.

And this from <i>The Era</i> on 19 August 1905 when the film was shown in London as <Two Little Vagabonds</i>:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Two lads, about 10 and 15, steal from farmhouse eggs, chickens, rabbits, and a frying-pan, being chased by the owner. They prepare 
a breakfast by lighting hay by the side of a haystack. The haystack catches fire, and they are pursued by the irate farmer, his 
farm hands, and a dog. They fly through lovely country rich with magnificent scenery, through ditches and over hedges, but are 
brought to a stop by a stream. The elder lad swims across, but the younger boy is captured and marched off between two elder lad 
swims across, but the younger boy is captured and marched off between two&nbsp;mounted policemen. Meanwhile his companion has doubled 
back and rescues the youngster. Magnificent quality throughout. One of the best we have ever taken. Very highly recommended.>

If the solid urban anchorage of cinema required a certain respect to be shown, as in the theatrical tradition, toward the (worthy) 
working-class citizenry, film-makers were free to treat country folk with merciless scorn. The one-minute <i>Le Petit voleur de 
pommes</i>, which appeared early in 1905 is the converse of urban comedies where it is the miscreants who are punished; here the 
miscreant is allowed to do the punishing and it is the wronged yokel who gets an entirely undeserved beating. "Great draw" accrding 
to <i>The Era</i> (15 April 1905) when the film was shown in London.

Un petit voleur, en train de dévaliser un pommier, est surpris par le propriétaire. Vite, il glisse de l’arbre et telle une souris 
disparaît par un trou du mur. Le paysan a voulu prendre le même chemin, mais il a compté sans sa rotondité et il arrive à être pris

<a name="gaumont"></a><h4>Gaumont</h4>
At Gaumont artistic director Alice Guy was primarily absorbed during 1905-1906 in two major projects, one being her major new version of 
The Passion, the first since the various versions produced 1897-1902 by Hatot and Breteau successively for Lumière, Gaumont and Pathé 
but on a much grander scale.  Her second preoccupation, and a project dear to the heart of Gaumont himself, was pthe roduction of well 
over  100 <i>phonoscènes</i> for use with the «&nbsp;chronophone Demenÿ&nbsp;», a machine effectively stolen, like the original Gaumont 
camera, from the hapless Georges Demenÿ which combined the recording of images with an approximately synchronised recording of sound 
on a phonograph cyclinder or disc. The films were very short, none exceeding three minutes) but the process was laborious since 
it involved not only the recording but the picturisation of the scene by the performers in sync with the playback recording. Sadly 
both for Guy and Gaumont the resulting scenes would never enjoy the hoped-for success. They were nevertheless widely difused at Gamumont 
cinemas in France and shown in the United States and Gaumont, reluctant to give up on the project, would continue to produce further 
photoscenes long after the departure of Guy and would only finally abandon the project altogether in 1917.
<br><br>
Necessarily, with so much on her hands, Guy relied heavily on her various assistants to produce the rest of the films - and particularly 
the comic shorts - that were required to full out the year's catalogue.  The most important of these assistant was Louis Feuillade, 
an ex-journalist who joined the company in 1906 essentially as a scenarist. Along with Feuillade came Étienne Arnaud and, at around 
the same time, they were joined by Italian Roméo Bosetti. The result of all this new blood was to give the comany and its repertoire 
a remarkably "laddish" flavour considering it was overseen by a woman.  Feuillade and Arnaud were long-time friends, both Southerners 
from the same area in the <i>département</i> of the Hérault in Languedoc, a region whose culture was dominated by the bullfight-town 
of Béziers. They were both passionate <i>aficionados</i> of the «&nbsp;corrida&nbsp;». Feuillade had been the reviwer or «&nbsp;revistero&nbsp;» 
for the journal <i>Le Torero</i>, had written a serial <i>Mémoires d'un toréador français</i> and, together with Arnaud was co-founder 
of «&nbsp;le Tori-Club Parisien&nbsp;». What is more, the two of them had become involved in cinem through yet another bull-fight 
fan, met at the club, André Heuzé who had himself started work as scenarist with Pathé just the year before. He would write and direct 
the film <i>La Mort d'un toréador</i> for Pathé in 1907. The effects of this new blood on the Gaumont repertoire would become 
increasingly apparent in 1906 as Guy became more and more preoccupied with her work on the <i>phonoscènes</i> in advance of a major 
assault on the cinemas planned for 1907 and the laddish elements around her became more active in detrmining the nature particularly 
of the comedy-films made.
<br><br>
How Guy felt about all this laddishness is difficult to know but she was no prude and may have rather enjoyed it.  She was certainly, 
in later years, always complimentary about her assistants.
<br><br>
For some elements in the "new look" at Gaumont, Alice Guy was clearly herself responsible. She was perfectly well aware of the 
need to keep abreast of the competition (and Gaumont himself was always there to remind if she should forget) and talks in her 
memoirs of finding inspiration, <i>inter alia</i> in the sensational "terror" genre then in vogue at the théätre du Grand-Guignol 
which apparently provided material for three films, one based on André de Lorde's 1901 play <i>Au téléphone</i> (the film name is 
unknown), another on Oscar Méténier's 1897 play <i>Lui!</i> (the film was called <i>L'Assassin</i> or <i>L'Assassin de la vieille 
femme</i> and a third based on an unidentified play called <i>Le Paralyique</i>. The last, possibly the film catalogued as <i>Lèvre 
clos</i> (1905) is perhaps the story of a stroke-victim unable to warn his son that his wife is an adulteress, the same unidentifed 
French story on which the 1909 Dutch film <i>De Greep</i> is based. None, alas, survive.  The first, <i>Au téléphone</i>, was very 
definitely with the intention of competing; the play was, as we have seen, adapted the same year by Lucien Nonguet for Pathé as <i>Terrible 
Angoisse</i> and would become a kind of cinematic classic. Méténier's play was a Grand-Guignol piece (a gruseome tale about a murderous 
butcher on the loose in a brothel) but Méténie regarded himself as a "naturalist' rather than a mere sensatioalist and, like André 
de Lorde, had also written plays for the "naturalist" theatre of André Antoine (both at the théatre libre and later at the théätre 
Antoine).
<br><br>
Another venture of 1904-1905 was the film of risqué humour and here again it is Guy herself who claims to be inspired by the work 
ofartist and illustrator Albert Guillaume (1873-1942) but not so much that fine artist's more "serious" work but rather his somwhat 
off-colour caricatures. Guy cites two examples. <i>Professeur de langues vivantes</i> is about a father and son who unwittingly 
end up in a brothel thinking they are attending a language-school and may well be the film catalgoued as <i>Le Lorgnon accusateur</i> 
since the problem is caused by the father failing to wear his spectacles to read the newspaper. Guy recalls that Gaumont sarcastically 
asked her in relation to this film if she was famiiar with "the milieu".  The other, <i>Amoureux transis</i> (the film is called <i>Gage 
d'amour</i>, is about two lovers, too engrossed in each other to notice that the area from which he is picking her a flower has just 
been thoroughly pissed on by a whole pack of dogs. She presses the proferred flower to her lips. Again, neither of the films is known to 
have survived except for a still of the second film.

A major Alice Guy production of May or June 1905 was <i>Réhabilitation</i> (<i>Reform</i>), a story about a young man who commits 
a theft to pay off his gambling debts but then redeems hiself by going off and fighting heroically in some conveneint colonial war 
or other. The noble castigation of "fuzzy-wuzzies", in the equally noble to civilise them, seems to have played an enormously 
important secondary role in the rehabilitation of upper-class European delinquents. Their lower-class euivalents - the «&nbsp;apaches&nbsp;» 
for instance - just ended up «&nbsp;en bagne&nbsp;» in Cayenne. The French empire was evidently built not on the paying fields of 
some French Eton but in the casino at Deauville.

One film that was certainly made by one of Guy's assistants, Roméo Bosetti, and which appeared in summer 1905, was <i>Les Expressions 
photographiques</i>. An original concept, the story of a family told through their involvemet at every stage of their life with 
the camera, it packs an awful lot into three minutes:
<br><br>
<blockquote>

<a name="tpathe"></a><h4>Théophile Pathé</h4>
<div class="dropright"><img class="purple" style="float: right; margin: 5px" src="images/people/tpathe.jpg"  height=250 width=240 border=2 alt="Théophile Pathé" title="Théophile Pathé">

Théophile Pathé (1886-1923) was a scapegrace younger brother of Charles and Émile, who had been associated with 
them in the very early days in 1896 but neither of the two younger brothers, Théophile and Jacques, had joined with their elders 
in forming Pathé frères. He had run a <i>café concert</i> for a while but ruined himself by playing the stock market, which necessitated 
his return to the Pathé family home at Buttes-Chaumont. He subsequently ran a hotel with equal lack of succss and in 1903, when 
Pathé frères opened a branch in Berlin, Théophile went, at brother Charles' suggestion, as their representative in Germany (1903-1905). 
Here he managed to prove a thorn in th flesh of his elder brother by rather surprisingly championing the cause of Georges Méliès, 
whose films he proposed to distribute, forming the Pathé branch into a separate company, Th. Pathé frères along with the youngest 
Pathé brother, Eugène. In 1905 he had founded his own small production house in the Boulevard Now at complete logger-heads with 
Charles, who simply opened the official Pathé office elsewhere, Théophile returned to France where he established himself in the 
Boulevard Gambette in Paris on the rather ominous date 15 March 1905. He had lured away from his brother the <i>décorateur</i> 
Hugues Laurent and an operator by the name of Wentzel. Wentzel seemingly proved incompetent as a director and Théophile, learning 
the trade as he went along,increasingly involved himself directly in the film-making. Initially it would seem they simply duped 
the films of other companies but by the end of 1905 were producing original films such as <i>La Loi du pardon</i>, perhaps originally 
entitled <i>La Lettre au don Dieu</i> and <i>La Retraite</i>, both of which were promptly remade, under different titles, by Pathé frères 
(as <i>La Loi du pardon</i> and <i>Le Déserteur</i> respectively), both of which appeared in 1906. One needs to be a little bit 
cautious since the evidence for this no doubt rests on the account of Théophile's daughter, Suzanne, whose memories in this respect 
are not necessarily reliable (see below) and both these Pathé films were written by André Heuzé and <i>La Loi du pardon</i> was 
certainly <a href="french06.html#ldp">a very major film directed by Albert Capellani</a>.

The film concerned the question of divorce and the resulting problems involving the custody of the children. The three children,  
seen in the background in the still, are all little Pathés, three of Théphile's other children - Théophile junior, Roger and Marie-Charlotte. 
No films of Théophile's company are known to survive and he would give up the business for good in 1907, allowing a man with another 
famous name in the hisory of cinema, Alexandre Promio, picture left, the Lumières' former star-operator, who continued to run the 
company with a certain success from 1908-1909. Théophile would only merit the smallest footnote in cinema history were it not for 
two small things. One was his interest, ahead of his time, in the production of longer films, even if he himself never eally had 
the means to match his ambitions.  This seems, however, to have been his thinking in championing the work of Méliès while in Germany 
and was also perhaps the motive for employing, along with Promio in 1907, the financier and novelist Paul Laffitte who was a strong 
proponent of what was coming to be known as "the art film", in practice at this time signifying a longer film with more literary content. 
Laffitte would go on, in 1908, to found Le Film d'Art, the first company to be specifically devoted to the making of such films.

<br><br>
Théophile has one further claim to fame.  It was he who first employed the young Max Linder in 1905 and made with him a film based 
on an old vaudeville gag, already filmed more than once by Pathé frères with different vaudeville stars, <i>Les Débuts d'un collégien</i>, 
in which a college-boy smokes his first cigar. Pathé frères predictably snapped up Linder too and Louis Gasnier would make several 
films casting Linder in similar roles (as college boys or young ingenus) including <i>Le Premier cigare d'un collégien</i> (1908).
