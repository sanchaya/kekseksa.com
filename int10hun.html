<h3><a name="hunt"></a>Hunting Films</h3>
<p>
During 1910, Pathé contnued to roll out the various films shot by Alfred Machin duing his film-tour of Central and East Africa.
<div align="center">

<p>
Pathé did not rely solely on the efforts of Machin and Doux to ensure that his company were the leading producers of hunting films. 
Two further films that would later be released for the Pathé-Baby home projector were in fact originally shot at this time. One is 
a rather attractive film of hunting with falcons in Algeria, <i>Chasse au faucon en Algérie</i>, which came out in January, originally 
five minutes long, and went on to make two films that were as direct response to Nordisk as it was possible to make. One, the eight-minute 
<i>Chasse à l’ours en Russie</i>, which came out in May, bore exactly the sme title as the Nordisk film that had snaffled the honours 
at Hamburg. It was brought out in the US on 10 December as <i>Bear Hunt in Russia</i> (the Nordisk film had been called <i>Bear Hunting 
in Russia</i>) and received the usual notice in <i>The Moving Picture World</i>:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Our operator was fortunate to be on the ground when an interesting bear hunt took place in far-away Russia, that land of snow and heavy 
coated animals. We watch the hunting party as they start out in their sleighs early in the morning, muffled up to the chin in heavy fur 
coats. The snow looks so white and beautiful in this land of long, severe winters, one envies these huntsmen for the day of sport that 
lies before them. When they reach the forest they look around for Bruin's footprints and soon come upon his tracks. Men and dogs follow them, 
and soon the beaters have the huge beast within range of the huntsmen's rifles. A bullet well aimed hits the bear and he staggers but decides 
to sell his life at a high price, and falling upon one of the men, sinks his teeth into his arm. The others rush to the assistance of their 
companion and one of them, making a tourniquet, stops the flow of blood from the wounded member. He is then carried back to the camp by some 
of the party. Bruin, whom the dogs have now pretty well exhausted, is still fighting them off as they jump around him, snapping and howling. 
We see, however, that his strength is almost spent, and soon, after giving two or three groans, the magnificent fellow breathes his last. 
The hunters hurry over to him, and calling off the dogs, fasten his feet to a pole and carry him off to the camp, a fine specimen for their 
first day's hunting. 
</blockquote>
<br><br>
The piece, evidently based on a text provided by the company itself, is almost laughable in its deliberately pointed emphasis on the 
fact that the hunt in question "took place in far-away Russia" (none of this present in the French Pathé catalogue description) and 
on how fortunate the operators were to be present.  The other hunting film was <i>Grande chasse à l'ours blanc dans les mers polaires</i>, 
originally a seven-minute film, which was shown, logically enough, in December. Not only had <i>Polar Bear Hunt</i> been the first 
of the Nordisk films back in 1907 but a polar bear standing on a globe was also Nordisk's trademark. But heer the effort made by the 
Pathé operators in their desperation to compete has actually pushed them towards the cutting edge of exploration. <i>The Moving 
Picture World</i> notice is again worth quoting, even though the film itself is available, albeeit much abbreviated, to watch because 
it underlines (just as in the previous notice for <i>Bear Hunt in Russia</i> the authenticity of the filming and makes a very telling 
reference to the Robert Peary expedition to the Pole which had only just returned from the region.
<br><br>
<blockquote>
This picture opens with the hunting party about to disembark from the steamer anchored in a sheltered spot in the Arctic. Ice floes 
are to be seen on every hand, and in the distance a berg may be noted on which two polar bears are gamboling. The hunting party having 
descended into a rowboat, pull for the nearest ice floe. Here they haul up their boat, and drag it across the ice to the next open lead. 
Then into the water and on again. After this difficult trip is nearly accomplished, one of the hunters take a long shot at the polar bears, 
who in the meantime having seen the hunters approach, have made a wild break for liberty, running across the ice, and swimming the open water. 
As the hunter fires one bear drops. The party now advance to within a few paces of the big white beast, but as they approach they grow cautious 
for fear Sir Bruin is not dead. Sure enough, when they are quite close, the bear stands up on his hind legs and shows light, but the foremost 
huntsman dropping on one knee, fires another bullet and Mr. Bear spins around, turns a somersault and drops in a lump on his head. Loading 
the carcass into the boat, returning to the ship and hauling the game aboard, are successively shown, and the picture ends with a view on 
board showing two polar bear cubs which have been captured. From the savage way these cubs attack their chains, one would scarcely be led 
to believe they would make good house pets. The film is not only interesting, in its vivid depiction of a hunting scene, but also in the fact 
that it is taken in the very region in which Commander Peary so recently made his world-startling discovery. 
</blockquote>
<br>
The Pathé-Nordisk rivalry is in itself awe-inspiring, rather like the bitter rivalry of Peary and Cooke, but it sometimes seems, in both the 
case of the film-producers and of the artic explorers, in its intensity and single-mindedness, to border occasionally on the insane.

So Pathé managed not only to begin and end the year with hunting films (the last being the most patent <i>bras d'honneur</i> 
in the direction of Nordisk but had also been able to replicate Nordisk's most recent Russian bear-hunt film in May and present 
a fine hand-coloured version of a panther hunt in August and had, what is more, a plentiful store of material filmed by Machin 
and Doux to show over the next two years.  It as an impressive achievement but it could still not really be said to have had the 
<i>éclat</i>, not to say <i>culot</i> of the Nordisk film that had started all the frenzy. The last laugh remained with Olsen 
but Pathé and he Pathé operators had learned a great deal in the process and had become, whether they would or not, pioneers of 
the cinema of exploration and ethnography.
<br><br>
Africa must have been beginning to wonder by this time what had hit it and why it was the focus all of a sudden of such a flurry 
of excited attention.  One of the biggest headline-grabbing stories of 1910 was the arrival there on safari of former president 
Theodore Roosevelt. No sooner had his second term as President ended in March than he left New York (on the 23rd) with the expeditionary 
party known as the Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition with a view to spending four months in the wilds of East Africa, hunting 
big game in parts of what are now Kenya and Uganda. TR arrived in Mombasa on 23 April 1909 to find a cameraman awaiting him in 
the form of Yorshireman Cherry kearton, who had been dispatched to Africa by US-born British producer Charles Urban with a view 
to covering the Roosevelt and, of course, to filming a "real" lion-hunt in the aftermath of Nordisk's <i>Løvejagten</i>. Kearton 
was a specialist wildlife photographer but had to this point specialised principally in bird (the rival to Britain's oyther ace 
birdlife photographer, Oliver Pike). This African expedition would change the entire orientation of his career. Meanwhile, back in 
the US, the cartoonists, Roosevelt's best enemies, had a field day. This twenty-second film animation is part of the collection 
helf by the Library of Congress in Washington:

The evidence suggests that audiences in the US were then as they would be now, rather less blood-thirsty in their tastes than 
Europeans and the "big game" hunting films do not seem to have exercised quite the same fascination there. US awareness of, and 
interest in, the peoples and cultures of the colonised countries of Asia and Africa was still far less developed than it was 
amongt their European counterparts. Hunting in the US was also, then as now, as much about shooting and gun-toting in general, 
as it was about sport. In the 1900s they had continue to produce occasional films of more familiar hunt-subjects (bear, possum 
and moose) without much troubling themselves about lions, tigers and eelphants, considered on the whole to be "zoo animals." In 
1910 Sigmund Lubin made a film, <i>Wild Duck Hunting on (Historic) Reel Foot Lake</i> in Tennessee, described by <i>The Moving 
Picture World</i>:
<blockquote>
Reel Foot Lake, the historic body of water created by the recession of the ground during an earthquake, is one of the most picturesque 
spots in Tennessee, being located close to the northwest corner where four States meet. One of the Lubin staff spent an entire week at 
this point recently and the result is some of the best pictures ever shown of real duck hunting. The lake is a favorite resting place 
with wild ducks in their migrations and at times the game is heavy. Time and patience were consumed in getting some actual hunting scenes 
in which the only preparation was the selection of points of view which should be both picturesque and productive of good sport. Ducks 
in flight are seen to be brought down by the gun of one of the most experienced hunters in that section and there is a really remarkable 
picture of a duck hit by a shot. It could not be anticipated, in point of fact a prepared picture was thrown out because it was unreal, 
but a happy chance gave the photographer the picture and quick wit and quicker action recorded it in the camera. The trees submerged at 
the time of the earthquake are still standing and these, with the heavy growths of marsh grass in combination with the heavy slack waters 
give some remarkable reflection pictures of mirror-like smoothness. It is an unusually attractive subject from every point of view. 
</blockquote>
Reelfoot Lake was, and is, no doubt a picturesque spot, a lake formed naturally by a series of earthquakes in the eary half of 
the nineetenth-century, but Lubin's choice of setting is not innocent. The area around the lake had also been notorious since 
1908 on account of the vigilante activities of militant tobacco-growers known as The Night Riders. Two attorneys representing 
the Tennessee Land Company had been lynched by hanging and shooting there in October 1908 although one had escaped, wounded, by 
swimming across the lake. Although six men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death for the lynching and D. W. Griffith 
would express his mild disapproval of their activities (more violent still in neighbouring Kentucky) in his 1911 film <i>The 
Rose of Kentucky</i>, they were in fact a striking example of the success of vigilante action since The American Tobacco Company 
(in many ways the real villains of the piece) conceded the farmers' demands in November 1908.
<br><br>
Edwin S. Porter had been sacked by Edison in November 1909 but his last films for the company appeared, posthumously as it were, 
in January 1909. <i>Bear Hunt in the Rockies</i> was filmed in Marble, Colorado. The trade-press was routinely complimentary:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Many pictures have been made of wild animals, but always, so far as we know, under conditions of captivity. In this picture, 
however, there is not the slightest departure from absolutely natural conditions. Nor is there any attempt at acting. An 
actual bear hunt is reproduced just as it occurred from the beginning to the end. Our representative was sent to Marble, Col., 
where he joined the camping outfit of Frank Dickens, hunter and guide, well known to all who hunt big game in that section of 
the country. Through the magic aid of the camera everyone who sees this picture is privileged to leave with the hunting party 
and to journey through the indescribably beautiful scenery of Colorado in the quest for the bear. We go through gorges and over 
mountains, penetrate forests and follow mountain trails where safety lies only in the surefooted horses; and all this in the 
very heart of the Rockies, with the snow-capped peaks showing in the distance. The altitude is about 10,000 feet, and both horse 
and man can do only a limited amount of work on account of the rarefied air. We go into camp, and from there we start on our 
actual hunt, accompanied by our dogs, barking in exultant chorus. The big bear is first seen swimming a stream from which a 
young woman is catching trout. The encounter is not at all to her liking, and she beats a precipitate retreat to camp. Taking 
advantage of the campers' absence, Bruin later on enters the camp, steals a grouse hanging alongside one of the tents and disappears 
with it into the forest. Here his quiet is broken by the having of the dogs, and this is the beginning of his end. We see him 
treed, the fatal shot fired which brings him to the ground, the fight with the dogs, and finally we see Bruin thrown across a 
horse's back and the journey back to camp. En route a young cub is roped and brought into camp in that manner, and the final 
scene shows the big bear swung up, with the dead cub on the ground.
<br><br>
Charles Pathé could have eaten his heart out. Not only does the reviewer show no knowledge of the exsitence of the kind of "real-life" 
he had been at such pains to have made since 1907 but it is clear, reading betwen the lines, that the Porter film, like the famous 
Nordisk films of 1907-1909, is in fact largely fictional. Another contemporary review approves but is not fooled:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
This fine film has educational as well as dome dramatuic value. It depicts what appeared to be a real bear hunt in the Rocky 
Mountains. The natural scenery is superb, and the bear is sur enough bear. A considerable party sets out on the hunt on horseback, 
and with pack horses conveying their camp material. In the party are two ladies - actor ladies evidently, as they fail at times 
to conceal their professional training. One of them goes fishing, and is having luck, when a bear appears.  She pretends to be 
frightened and starts to run, but in front of the camera comes the fatal desire to pose, and we realise the danger from the bear 
is mere pretense. When she arrives at the camp she again poses, facing the camera, while she tells her experience to those standing 
behind her. The dogs are now called, and the bear is pursued, treed and shot. We are mecifully spared a scene showing the details 
of butchering.  Later a cub is roped, and led home by the party.  Taken as a whole, the film is decidedly entertaining.  
<br><br>
Despite the irony, there is a clear and typical preference being expressed here for entertaining "fiction" over less palatable 
"fact". One notes the reviewer's relief at the absence of any scenes of butchery, which so frequently formed the climax of the 
factual European hunting films.
