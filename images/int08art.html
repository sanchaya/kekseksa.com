<a name="art"></a><h3>Art Films</h3>
<p>The concept of the "art" or "artistic" film (and at first the two were largely interchangeable) is one of the most nebulous and 
unhelpful to have infested the world of cinema. It is a totally subjective concept that does not define any form let alone any 
genre of cinema and, since it has not the slightest conceptual clarity, has frequently just served to confuse issues affecting 
film criticism and film historiography. But it has, virtually from the outset and throughout the subsequent history of cinema 
had its fervent proponents, generally more recognizeable by their social and professional profiles than by any clearly-defined 
artistic or ideological aims, and, even if what has actually been meant by "art" film has varied considerably from period to period 
and sometimes even within the same period and on the part of the same people and in almost the same breath, the social credentials 
of those people have changed remarkably little over the decades.
<br><br>
For the "art film" set, essentially a <i>côterie</i> of writers and artists with womething of a vested inteerst in the kind of cinema 
they proposed, to become something more of an "art film" movement, with an important effect upon the development of cinema, required 
essentially that they should have the ear of the producers who wielded the real power in the industry. In the US wheer producers 
were, <i>pace</i> Jean-Luc Godard, little inclined to reach for their chequebooks when they heard the word "art", this was plainly 
an impossibility.

<p>
Le Film d'art was founded in 1908 by Paul Laffitte. Laffitte had a curious but not untypical profile for an art-filmer in that he 
was both a novelist and a financier. He had also since 1905 been working for Théophie Pathé, the younger brother of Charles and 
Émile, who had not joined his elders in forming Pathé frères but had <a href=french05.html#tpathe">in 1905</a> founded his own 
small production house in the Boulevard Gambette in Paris. Laffitte was also asociated with the Compagnie des Cinéma-Halls founded 
in June 1907 by businessman Henri Daniel, taking over the defunct American Kineograph and leasing the Hippodrome (the future Gaumont-Palace). 
Approached by two distinguished figures from the Paris theatre world, Charkes Le Bargy of the Comédie française and novelist and 
playwright Henri Lavedan. In fact Le Bargy, although <i>sociétaire</i> of the Comédie française since 1887, was a rather frustated 
actor looking to reboost his career; Lavedan was a member of the Académie française (1889) but his career as a dramatist, after 
a run of sucesses 1902-1906 was also showing signs of becoming a bit sluggish. The original intention was no doubt to make use 
both of the facilities of Théophile Pathé's company, Th.Pathé frères (whose administrators were prominent amongst the subscribers

Charles Le Bargy</div>to Le Film d'art) and of the Cinéma-Halls (whose major shareholders also figured). This, however, fell through when the Compagnie 
des Cinéma-Halls was seen to be poorly managed and financially precarious. It eventually closed down in April 1909 and was declared 
bankrupt the following August.
<br><br>
To borrow a remark by Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan) in Peckinpah's <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, what Le Film d'art wanted and what it 
needed were two different things. The art-filmers would doubtless have liked to run their own production company in the way they 
wanted, but would have to progressively dilute their wine in order to be a going concern at all.  It is most unlikely, at least 
at this time, that any such venture could have succeeded without the support of the powers that wer, which essentially of course 
meant Charles Pathé.  The initial contract between Le Film d'art and Pathé frères signed on 7 March 1908, was careful to respect 
their independence - Pathé could afford to bide his time and had in any case other irons in the fire - but they were obliged to 
work exclusively for Pathé who, in return for providing raw materials, certain facilities and, most importantly, an editing service, 
would take a third of the profits. 
<br><br>
The language of the contract occasionally betrays the snobery that underlay much of the thinking of the art-filmers. One clause 
specifies:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
La clientèle avec laquelle traiteront les Sociétés pour la location, sera choisie ; elles ne loueront pas aux petits estaminets 
qui, pour 0,10 cts donnent une demi-heure de spectacle et une chope. Elles contribueront à rehausser le prestige des vrais cinématographes, 
que ces « locateurs » traînent dans la boue.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
Le Film d'Art was officially launched on 17 November 1908 at the Salle Charras (near the Opéra) with a programme of several films, of 
which the centrepiece was the 15-minute <i>L'Assassinat du duc de Guise</i> directed by Le Bargy and André Calmettes and accompanied 
by original music by Camille Saint-Saëns. The distinguished composer was amused by wat he called «&nbsp;le-cinéma-qui-vous-graphe&nbsp;» 
but he took his job very seriously, writing a suite for strings, piano and harmonium that was meticulously cued to match the action 
of the film. Saint-Saëns was in any case not uncommonly used in film-theatres and it was not so very extraordinary for a film-maker 
to call on composers for original works to accompany films. Mikhail Ippolotov-Ivanov composed a score for the Russian film <i>Stenka 
Rezin</i> in 1908.
<br><br>
I have not sought to disguise my scepticism with regard to he proponents of the art film; I think they were, on the whole, a bunch 
of pretentious hypocrites, partly well-intentioned, partly self-serving, whose views on what constituted a good film are rather 
debatable. But, once again, it is not personalities that count and assessing the value of the work of Le Film d'Art and its importance 
for the development of cinema is quite a different matter. The films produced between 1908 and 1910 are impressive in their scope. 
They include classic drama (Racine, Molière, Hugo, Regnard and Shakespeare) and opera (Tosca), adaptations of classic novels 
and short stories (Balzac, Maupasant, Prévost, Mistral and Tolstoy) but also, a fact sometimes overlooked, some light comedies (including 
one which supposedly featured Max Linder), two religious dramas, a spy story, several other historical dramas, two reconstructions 
of wartime scenes and four very interesting mime-ballets. In practice, that is to say, they took, perhaps predictably since the various 
writers involved were not always out of the top drawer, a more generous view of what constituted "art" than their rhetoric portended. 
<br><br>
Another important feature, and one on which Pathé had particularly relied, was their ability to rally the great and the good from 
the legitimate theatre. The stars of legitimate theatre, with the very remarkable exception of Sarah Bernhardt,
