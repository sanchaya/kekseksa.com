<h3><a name="hunt"></a>Hunting Films</h3>
<p>
<a name="lomstag"></a>In 1904 Urban released the last of Lomas' films of Devon and Somerset staghunts, a compilation of his films made for Warwick Trading 
and Urban Trading during the previous three years, a forty-part film of 220 metres (ten minutes or so) entitled <i>Hunting the Red 
Deer, with the Devon and Somerset Staghounds</i>, essentially a cineamtic equivalent of the book he had illustrated on the subject 
back in 1902. The stag is pursued downstream, eventually out into the Bristol Channel, to be brought back by fishermen. A print of 
the film was recently discovered and has been described by <a href="http://www.charlesurban.com/films_twenty.html">a website devoted 
to the films of Urban</a> as "a dazzling, if quite horrifying, <i>tour de force</i>, exceptionally well shot and edited." This is 
a reminder that hunting films, rather as earlier bullfighting films had done, served in early film-making as an important training-ground 
both for cinematography and editing. Unfortunately I have not had access to the film. By way of compensation, this is a film made 
of the Devon and Somerset in 1992, before the current ban on staghunting, by an opponent of of the sport.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Lomas and Urban were, however, quite unapologetic. assuring viewers that the stag "has had six years or more of good wild life, 
living as a king upon the wild moor, and has now given us a great run." The rival film companies, meanwhile, scraped the barrell, 
with British Gaumont producing <i>Fox Terrier Killing Rats</i>, an unconscious reminescence of eary films shot by William Kennedy 
Laurie Dickon for the Edison kinetoscope in the 1890s and Warwick Trading produced <i>Otter Hunt</i>. Otter-hunting films were, 
the only seemingly ones to provoke any kind of negative response, since, following another such film in 1905, Urban felt obliged 
to produce in 1906 the film <i>Is Otter Hunting Cruel?</i>, a very rare film to even question the propriety of hunting of any kind, 
even, presumably, it concluded that it was not cruel.
<br><br>
Another aspect of hunting assumed a certain importance in 1905 thanks to Warwick Trading, run since Urban's departure in 1903 by 
Will Barker (1868-1941), aho had previously run a small independent company called Autoscope. Barker was a man who would later 
have a very considerable importance in the development of the British film industry, but achieved little of any note whiile at 
Warwick. The company did however produce a film, not known to survive, <i>Whaling Off the Shetlands </i> in 1905, prsumably the 
ame film that features in the Edison catalogue for that year as <i>Whaling</i>.
<br><br>
One further Lomas-Urban film of stag-hunting,<i>A Devonshire Staghunt</> or <i>Hunitng the Red Deer</i> is recorded for 1905 but, 
since Lomas was by this time heavily engaged elsewhere, it seems likely that this is simply a rehash of <a href="int04hun.html#lomstag">the 
spectacular 1904 film</a> with which his series of staghunt films had culminated. Urban Trading also produced the film <i>Otter 
Hunting on Exmoor</i>, which seems to have provoked some negative response since Urban felt obliged to produce in 1906 the film 
<i>Is Otter Hunting Cruel?</i>, a very rare film to even question the propriety of hunting of any kind, even, presumably, it 
concluded that it was not cruel.Urban doe however seem to have harboured a certain affection for the otter; several years later (1912) 
he would produce the natural history film <i>An Ottter Study</i>. Warwick Trading was content to produce a more gentle picture of 
Exmoor in <i>The Land of Lorna Doone</i>.

optical instrument, photographic equipment company (Philadelphia) that also involved itself in the production of lantern-slides 
and in film distribution.
One of the most interesting hunt pictures ever shown. The film showing the subject is taken among the forests and along the streams in Canada. The hunters are after deer and caribou. The selection of the pictures shows every portion, as a herd of young deer is shown, also the picture shows very plainly the hunters firing and bringing down their game. Among the pictures is a view of the skinning and dressing of the hides and horns. This picture will create a sensation wherever shown, especially among people who are interested in fishing or hunting. Written by Moving Picture World synopsis

January 1907 <i>Beaver Hunt</i> Urrban
A hunting horn sounds in the distance, setting the village dogs barking with excitement, and soon round the corner of the lane there comes the master with his pack of big hounds and bevy of shaggy, rough-coated terriers, the latter yelping and straining at their leashes. Over the meadows we go first, hounds trying the stream bit by bit, then into the woods, where in the shade of the old trees and mass of tall tangled undergrowth, hounds are almost hidden from our view. We have scrambled over many hedges, helping the ladies over at some times, at others ungallantly having to leave them in order that we might get the bioscope's omniscient eye pointed upon the hounds as they begin to whimper and feather on some faint scent. Soon we leave the path and take to the water, wading in and out of cool pools, tripping and slipping on the boulders to the peril of the bioscope. The hills have closed in on either side, fine old oak trees, rich in green, their trunks covered with green lichen, rise up around us, yet we have not found a beaver. But what is that? One old hound hugging the bank gives a whimper, the others gather round, and the terriers, wishing to have their say, dash up and look important; then there is a splash, a streak of shining grey flits across the water, and we are away full cry. Hounds giving tongue, terriers barking, and some local country gentlemen loudly shouting, we race up stream: "Give the hounds room and don't yell," promptly cries the master; the whips take up their positions, cheering on the hounds, and thus we go up the stream, till at last, in a clear, deep pool, the sides of steep rock covered in rich green moss, among a tangled mass of dead tree trunks, the beaver gets away underground. Then the terriers have their day working down into her underground refuge, and out she pops to lead us yet further up among the hills, when, at last, surrounded and secured by hounds, it is caught.Urban-Eclipse catalogue
January 1907 <i>Whale Fishing</i>
In this series we embark on a whaler of about 500 tons register, with its usual complement of whaleboats and men, and proceed on a cruise in search of the leviathans. The sea effects are wonderful, and the rising and falling appearance of the water as the ship forges her way ahead is so realistic that the usual results to some constitutions seem actually imminent. In a lively sea, we are transferred to the whaleboat and shown the harpoon gun in position, fixed upon a small platform. Mounted on a swivel, the men demonstrate the fact that this gun commands both bows, as well as right ahead. A whale is sighted: the harpoon gun is fired, and we see that the weapon has found its mark, a long distance ahead. In corroboration, the whale is next shown, stiff and rigid, in the tossing waters. The monster is now made fast to the ship, and we see, almost feel, him, towed alongside, a weird spectacle. The seascape is a marvel of photography and the effects secured in this connection alone would amply recompense an enterprising firm for its reproduction. Our destination being reached, as we ride at anchor we casually notice what appear to be two islands covered with sea birds; but a second glance assures us that these islands are really dead whales, our own being one. We now disembark, and, in a cove of the sea, are shown the operation of flensing, or removal of the hide, blubber and whalebone from the carcasses of the two huge cetaceans, one measuring 84 and the other 78 feet, portrayed in life-like animation. A man runs up the head of one of the dead animals and makes an incision, others score its sides with long, sharp knives; a rope and pulley arrangement is secured to the incision at the head, a winch is started, and a long strip of hide is drawn from head to tail of the body. This process is repeated until the huge animal is entirely denuded of its hide and dissection takes place. Men cut up the blubber into pieces about a foot square, which are piled in readiness for the further processes of oil extraction. The skeleton only now remains, and this structure is so light that one man is seen to sway it backwards and forwards with a single hand. The finale of this marvelous series is reached by the removal, en bloc, of the whalebone from the upper jaw.Urban-Eclipse catalogue

<br><br>
The first seemingly to produce a "big game" huntingg film in Africa was the Anglo-French film-maker Émile Lauste (1880-1947). 
Lauste was the son of the pioneer mechanic Eugène Lauste (1857-1936) who had worked with William Kennedy Laurie Dickson in 
the 1880s and 1890s developing the Edison Kinetoscope and later with the Lathams developing the famous "Latham loop" mechanism. 
Lauste senior moved to Britain where he worked for a time for British Mutoscope and continued thereafter to work on various 
projects with W. K. L. Dickson and independently. Lauste worked as a very young man (1899) in the Netherlands, establishing 
the Dutch branch of Mutoscope Nederlandsche Biograaf- en Mutoscope Maatschappij and making some of the very earliest films 
ever to be made there. Probably he continued to work for British Mutoscope but disappears rather from the record until 1906 
when he re-emerges as one of Charles Urban's pioneer travel film-makers. In 1906-1907 he ws in Africa on what became known 
as «&nbsp;The Urban African Expedition&nbsp;» which travelled up the railway from the Cape to Cairo and was Advertised as being 
a <i>comprehensive documentation</i> of Southern Africa, The first film produced was Lauste's <i>Hippopotamus Hunt on the Zambesi</i> 
which was released sometime in 1906 and was shown, significantly as we shall see, in Denmark on 15 December 1906. It is the only 
hunting film Lauste is known to have made.
