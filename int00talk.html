<h3><a name="talk">The Talkies</a></h3>
Theoretically the man with most to gain from the synchonisation of sound and film, given his reputation as inventor of the phonograph 
(which, in parallel with Frenchman, Charles Cros, he was) and, by dint of a speculative patent, supposed inventor of the first moving-picture 
camera (which he emphatically was not). Yet, although the idea was present in his mind from the outset, and in spite of the fact 
that the original peephole Kinetoscope/Kinetophone did already employ a combination of sound and image, withut any serious attempt 
at synchronisation of the two, very little further was done towards realising such a project by the Edison studios until a much 
later date. 
<br><br>
Of the team that created the Kinetoscope for Edison - the Scotsman William Kennedy, Wiliam Heise, who would act as the first camerman 
and Frenchman Eugéne Lauste, it was almost cetainly Lauste, to judge by later work, who was the most technically capable. 
Eugène Augustin Lauste (1857-1935) was born in Paris, where he showed a precocious flair for all things mechanical and is said 
to have held fifty-three French patents by the age of twenty-three. He moved shortly after this to New Jersey and began to work 
for Edison in 1887. Lauste was sacked by Edison in 1892 as part of a major staff cut-back in advance of the economic recession 
of 1893-1894. but was quickly recuperated by Dickson, going to work in 1894 for the Latham family, with whom Dickson was also 
covertly collaboring and for whom, by Dickson's account, Lauste developed both their Eidolscope camara/projector and the famous 
"Latham loop" that isolated the film-strip and facilitated smooth projection, a system demonstrated on 21 April 1895 and repsonsible 
for the first certainly known commercial public screening of a film (<i>The Griffo-Barnett Boxing Match</i> in a Broadway tower-store 
on 20 May.
<br><br>
Lauste's role in the development of the Kinetoscope seems, on the other hand, to have been faitly minimal and it it undoubtedly 
therefore Dickson who principally deserves the credit for the first combined use of image and sound (the Kinetoscope/Kinetophone itself) 
as well as the first primitice attempt at synchronisation through simultaneous recording, producing, for Edison in 1894, the long-lost 
but now famous "experimental sound film" for Edison in 1894-1895, which shows two men dancing to the barcarolle <i>La Chanson de mousse</i> 
from the 1877 comic opera <i>Les Cloches de Corneville</i> by Robert Planquette (1848-1903), played by Dickson himself on the 
violin before a huge trumpet-megaphone. The film has fairly recently been restored (1998) to incorporate the surviving cylinder, 
seventeen-minutes of sound film, almost certainly rather better synchronised in its modern restoration than it actually was at the 
time the film was made.
<br><br>
In 1896 Dickson, discovered is his moonlighting activiies for the Lathams and frustrated by Edison's obstinate refusal to make the 
obvious move to a system of film-projection, left to form part of the K.M.C.D syndicate that would create the American Mutoscope 
Company (later he American Mutoscope and Biograph Company) on 30 December 1895. The Lathams, despite the head-start provided for 
them by Lauste, were obliged by poor management and constant internal disputes to dissolve the company in 1896 and Lauste then 
promptly joined Kennedy at Mutoscope. If Edison, faced by the prospect of the arrival of the Lumière cinématographe in the US, 
finally accepted the necessity of developing a camera/projector (the Vitascope), he did so by appropriating the work of other inventors 
(Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins) and, in the absence of Kennedy and Lauste, little further in the way of technical 
innovation could be expected from that corner. 
<br><br>
Auguste Blaise Baron (1855-1938), known in France, since the rediscovery of is work in the 1930s, as «&nbsp;le père du cinéma parlant&nbsp;» 
(the father of the talkies) was a photographer, musician and inventor. After seeing the Edison Kinetoscope in Paris in 1895, he 
realised immediately that the ultimate future of cinematography lay in a combination of projection, sound and colour and set himself 
the task of trying to effect this.  His first apparatus for sound/image synchronisation was patented on 3 April 1896. His «&nbsp;graphophonoscope&nbsp;»  
There is litle evidence that the apparatus actually worked very successfully but what is interesting to note is that it envisaged 
a direct and simultaneous recording of both sound and image, not the "playback" system (whereby actors subsequently mimed the action 
in synchronisation with the sound recording) that would generally be employed during the years that followed. In a more susccesful 
version patented in 1898, the simultaneous recording of sound and image was effected by means of a <i>disposif électrque</i> (electric 
mtor) linking both recording devices.
<br><br>
Of the films made by Baron that survive, those shot in 1896-1897 were almost certainly not made with synchrnised sound. Between 
1897-1900, however, Baron had the use of his newly-built glasshouse studio in Asnières (outisde Paris), almost certainly the 
first studio entirely devoted to the making of sound films, and the fims made during this period were certainly made with sound 
even if, we no longer possess the phonograph cylinders that should accompany them. They include dances, the inevitable Loêe Fuller 
type dance, three films of an unamed dancer in a long robe, <i>Mlle J. Duval, Étoile de la Gaieté, dans une de ses variations</i> 
and two scenes from the ballet <:>L'Étoile</i> (1897) by Adolphe Aderer and Camille de Roddaz with choreography by Joseph Hansen 
and music by André Wormser (1851-1925). 
<br><br>
Songs include <i>Chanteuse d'opéra</i> and <i>Chanteur d'opéra</i>, <i>La Chanteuse</i>, <i>Petit marin sur scène</i>, <i>Portrait 
parlant et musical par une artiste de l'Opéra</i>, <i>Au vieux pot</i>, a comic song set outside an inn and a film of <i>café concert</i> 
artiste Éloi Ouvrard (Ouvrard père) singing <i>Les Trois cuirassiers</i>.
<br><br>
There is a film of a trumpet-player (<i>Joueur de cornet</i>, a scene of <i>boule</i>-players interrupted by a (presumably noisy) 
child and dog (<i>Joueurs de boules</i>, a scene of Swiss wrestlers (<i>Lutteurs suisses</i> and another of juggling (<i>Un jongleur</i>. 
Of two films of a trained dog, one, <i>Un dresseur de chien</i>, where a dog jumps over a chair, is described as a «&nbsp'film musical&nbsp; 
and there was presumably similar musical accompaniment for its companion-piece, <i>Pitrerie sur deux échelles</i> where the same 
dog jumps over two stools.
<br><br>
Not certainly sound films are five made of Félicien Trewey doing his celebrateed imitations, involving a quick-change of hats, 
an act he had recreated for his friend Louis Lumière in 1896 but which was filmed by several of the early French cinematographers.
<br><br>
Most certainly sound films are the various recitals and monologues. <i>Monsieur Lagrange des théâtres de Paris dans le récit du 
songe d'Athalie</i>, according to Baron, was the film that particularly impressed the veteran French physiologist and inventor Étienne-Jules 
Marey when he saw it. <i>Athalie</i> is of course Jean Racine's play of 1691 and the dream - Racine at his most vibrant - is described 
in Act II:
<div align="center">
<pre class="poem">
C'était pendant l'horreur d'une profonde nuit.
Ma mère Jézabel devant moi s'est montrée,
Comme au jour de sa mort pompeusement parée.
Ses malheurs n'avaient point abattu sa fierté&nbsp;;
Même elle avait encor cet éclat emprunté
Dont elle eut soin de peindre et d'orner son visage,
Pour réparer des ans l'irréparable outrage.
«&nbsp;Tremble, m'a-t-elle dit, fille digne de moi.
Le cruel Dieu des Juifs l'emporte aussi sur toi.
Je te plains de tomber dans ses mains redoutables,
Ma fille.&nbsp;» En achevant ces mots épouvantables,
Son ombre vers mon lit a paru se baisser&nbsp;;
Et moi, je lui tendais les mains pour l'embrasser.
Mais je n'ai plus trouvé qu'un horrible mélange
D'os et de chairs meurtris et traînés dans la fange,
Des lambeaux pleins de sang et des membres affreux
Que des chiens dévorants se disputaient entre eux.
</pre>
</div>
<br><br>
The other spoken films were <i>Madame Baron présentant le Graphophonoscope aux séances de démonstrations</i>, <i>Femme récitant 
sur scène</i> and <i>Monologue avec phonographe</i>. In <i>Femme récitant</i>, the ornate stage-curtain of the Asnières studio rises 
to reveal the woman in question and falls at the completion of her recitation. In another untitled film, a man being photographed 
mimes a dialogue with the cameraman.
<br><br>
Most of the work with synchronised was probably not carried out until 1899 but for the fact that it was carried out we have the 
testimony of Félix Mesguich, the former Lumière operator, and later the operator for Photo-Cinéma-Théâatre, who became Baron's chief 
assistant in 1899 (seated before the curtain in the photograph above):
<br><br>
<blcokquote>
C'est sur un écran français que se produisit la plus ancienne tentative d'harmoisation synchrone de cylindre-phono avec l'image 
cinéma, forme primitive du cinéma sonore. M. Auguste Baron en est l'auteur. Avant tous les autres, à ma connaissance, il a donné 
une âmeau cinéma en le dotant de la parole et, si ma mémoire est fidèle, le brevet de sa découverte, le «&nbsp:patent&&nbsp;», était 
enregistré dès l'année 1900 aus États-unis. Dans le modeste studio de la rue dw l'Alma à Asnières, je deviens son collaborateur 
pour les prises de vues. Nous produisons ensemble des scènes d'opérettes, chant et musique, ainsi que des «&nbsp;vieilles chansons 
de France&nbsp;» interprétées par les artistes de concet ou de music-hall. M. Baron n'a guère profité des ses brevets. En France  
où l'esprit pratique n'accompagne pas toujours la génie, il est rare qu'une invention enrichisse son auteur. Comme tant d'autres, 
M. Baron en fit l'espérience. Il n'est pas inutile de le rappeler, aujourd'hui que le parlant a pris possession de tous les écrans.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
Mesguish's The sad remarks in Baron's unpublished memoirs about the fate of his inventions are worth quaoting, for they apply, as he quite 
rightly points out, to a great many early pioneers of cinema, not only in France but throughout the world.
<br><br>
<blockquote>
J'étais né pour être inventeur, malheureusement pour ma famille à laquelle je ne devais léguer à la fin de ma vie qu'un nom honoré 
et connu mais sans aucune richesse. La plupart de mes inventions découlent de la photographie, seule branche que j'avais vraiment 
étudiée à fond étant jeune. Ma destinée a été d'enrichir les autres par le produit de mon cerveau. C'est le sort de tous les précurseurs 
en France.
</blockquote>
<br><br> 
In 1903 he gave his canera equipment and films to the musx130 des Arts et Métiers (CNAM) where they remained until their transfer in 1970 
to the CNC.
<br><br> 
After the "rediscovery" of Baron, now poverty-stricken and almost totally blind, and of what remained of his legacy, in and around 
1931, Léon Gaumont found himself uncer fierce attack in France for his failure to acjnowledge his predecessor. Uncomfortabbly, 
Gaumont attempted to minimise the work of Baron and even cast doubt upon the truth of it. «&nbsp;Ah ah&nbsp;! Vous veneez pour 
le parlant (you come about the talkies), tHe blind old man greeted journalists who came to interview him, «&nbsp;J'en suis le 
përe (I am the father of them)&nbsp;». After his death in 1938, the writer Maurice Bessy delivered one of the most damning judgements 
ever made of a major film producer in the journal <i>Cinémonde</i> (3 Februrary 1938): «&nbsp;Auguste Baron a découvert le parlant. 
Il est pauvre. M. Léon Gaumont a "utilisé" le cinéma parlant. Il est riche.&nbsp;» (Auguste Baron discovered the talkies. He is 
poor. Léon Gaumont "used" the talkies. He is rich). There is perhaps more righteous anger in this judgement than strict justice 
but theer are perhaps when righteous anger is appropriate and the French can, nevertheless, feel proud that such a judgement could 
be rendered. I rather doubt if, in the US, it would be possible to simlarly challenge the inflated reputation of Tomes Alva Edison 
without being accused of being "unAmerican". This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.
<br><br>
The issue of Baron's "paternity" of sound film is complicated by th fact that he was far from the only pioneer experimenting with sound. 
The German physicist Ernst Walter Rühmer (1878-1913) was a high-powered reaeacher in a number of different fields. His work on light-sensitive 
selenum cells had immesuareby improved the Alexander Bell telephone system (greatly increasing its range), was a pionner in wireless 
telephony and, by 1909, had even produced the first experimental television transmissions. As early as 1900, as part of his optical wireless telephone 
research, Rühmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll 
of photographic film. He then perceived that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip. 
Although he enthused over the invention of what he called the photographophone ("It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, 
becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound."), he was an experimental scientist 
and not a film-maker and di not, at this time, pursue the matter any further, but the principle discovered was in practice that of "sound 
on film".

Some of the most important early development in "talking pictures" were stimulated by the Paris Exposition of 1900. One of the 
most notable cinematic events at the Exposition was «&nbsp;Le Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» financed by Paris businessman Paul Decauville 
(1846-1922) and with actress and dancer Marguerite Vrignault Chenu (1861-c. 1933), supposedly the original inspiration of the project, as <i>directeur 
artistique</i>. The films were made by the Lumières' former Paris <i>concessionnaire</i> Clément-Maurice, using the Cinépar «&nbsp;camera&nbsp;» 
created by Ambrose-François Parnaland (1854-1913), and the «&nbsp:Idéal&nbsp;» <i>phonographe</i> of Henri Lioret (1848-1838), 
later replaced (19 September) by the Pathé <i>phonographe</i> «&nbsp;Le Céleste&nbsp;». Lioret was also responsible for the system 
of "playback" sound-synchronisation. The projection-room at the Exposition was built by the architect René Dulong (1860-1944), 
and was based on Ange-Jacques Gabriel's Pavilion frais (1751) in the Petit Trianon at Versailles. The <i>décors</i> were by the 
painter François Flameng (1856-1923), who also designed the magnificent poster showing Sarah Bernhardt in costume as Tosca, although 
no such scene was actually filmed for the show. Projection was in the hands of Clément-Maurice's two sons, Georges and Léopold.

Clément Maurice Gratioulet <dit> Clément-Maurice (1853-1933) was an ex-employee of the Lumière photographic factory at Monplaisir, 
Lyon and a close friend of Antoine Lumière and his sons, who had followed with interest their work both with new photographic 
processes and the development of the <i>cinématographe</i>. He became a professional photographer with a studio at 8, boulevard 
des Italiens in Paris, just above Georges Méliès' théâtre Robert-Houdin, and it was he who arranged the rental of the Salon Indien, 
at the Grand Café, for the first public Lumière show on 28 December 1895, and who took charge of the till for the first performances. 
He later recalled how the the owner had, unwisely, rejected the offer of a percentage of the takings, preferring a fixed daily rent 
of thirty francs. Clément-Maurice was the official Paris <i>concessionnaire</i> for the Lumières and continued to manage the Lumière 
programme at the Grand Café for some time, while remaining a particularly active figure in the burgeoning Paris film scene. He 
acted as camera operator, with the assistance of his teenage son Leopold and the additional operator Ambroise-François Parnaland, 
to the surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen for the filming of his operations in 1898. In March 1898 he won first prize in the world's first 
film competition, held in Monaco, for his film <i>Monaco vivant par les appareils cinématographiques</i>. In 1900 he devised, 
with Henri Lioret, the «&nbsp:Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» at the Paris Exposition, where synchronised sound films were made of 
extracts from plays and of artistes such as Sarah Bernhardt, Coquelin, Gabriel Réjane, Little Tich and many others.

The «&nbsp:Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» opened on 29 April 1900. The programme consisted of a three-tableau excerpt from the pantomime 
<i>L'Enfant prodigue</i> («&nbsp:Le Vol&nbsp;»,«&nbsp:Pierrot chez Phrynette&nbsp;» and «&nbsp:Le Retour&nbsp;») by Michel Carré 
(1821-1872) with music by André Wormser starring Felicia Mallet as Pierrot and Marie Magnier as Madame Pierrot. Mallet (1863-1928) was from 
the original 1890-1900 cast at the théâtre de Bouffes). Magnier (1848-1913) had in fact replaced Irma Crosnier in the part of the 
mother. The part of Phrynette, originally played on the stage by Biana Duhamel (1870-1910) was advertised intriguingly on tis occasion 
as being played by "Mlle X". One would like to think that the part was perhaps played on this occasion by Biana's little sister

Sarah (1873-1926), who, as Rosalie and Pétronille, would later be a major star of early film comedy. 
<br><br>
There was also a scene of mimed theatricals («&nbsp:Le Piston de Hortense&nbsp;») from the second act of a three-act comedy <i>Ma 
Cousine</i> by Henri Meilhac (1830-1897), created at the théâtre des Variétés on 27 October 1890 and starring one of the <i>monstres 
sacrés</i> of <i>belle époque</i> theatre, and the great rival of Sarah Bernhardt, Gabrielle-Charlotte Reju <dite> Gabrielle Réjane (1856-1920). 
A hugely successful comedy - it ran for over two hundred consecutive performances - <i>Ma Cousine</i> features the intrigues of a Paris 
socialite Gabrielle, played by Réjane, on behalf of her cousin Clotilde who is trying to win back her husband Raoul from his new lover, 
Victorine (here played by a certain Mlle Avril). The comedy contains a play within a play supposedly written by Victorine's husband, 
Champcourtier and this play within the play begins with a pantomine (a comic polka). This scene, from Act II of the play, is a rehearsal 
of the pantomime which also features two actors called Lubas and Numa, presumably playing Raoul and Champcourtier, and the scene culminates 
in the polka, suitably accompanied by "lustful glances and jealous reproaches". to quote the author of a modern adapatation of the Melihac play, 
David Nicholson.  Interestingly in Nicholson's adaptation (updated to the 1920s), he has the rather good idea of having Champcourtier 
say that he ddoes not call his dance scene a pantomine but is trying to to combine the best of moving pictures with the best of the 
stage.  The curtains part . . . and the audience can read the preamble written on large cards – we call them titles – then the actors 
enter and, well . . . act – and the next title tells the audience what they are saying to one another, and so on, just like at the 
cinema . . . and then they dance a tango"  None of this could of course possibly been said, or even thought, in 1900, let alone in 
1890 when the play was written, but provides nevertheless a certain insight into the complicated reflexive relationship already involved 
in a film of a pantomime within a play.

Réjane was less eager in general to perform for the camera than Bernhardt but would appear again for Le Film d'Art in 1908 and 1911 as 
well as starring in Henri Pouctal's propagandist wartime drama, <i>Alsace</i> in 1916 and appearing in a small role in Louis Mercanton's 
<i>Miarka, la fille à l'ourse</i> in 1920.
<br><br>
Sarah Bernhardt herself appeared in the duel scene from <i>Hamlet</i> with Pierre Magnier as Laertes and Suzanne Seylor as «&nbsp;l'homme 
d'armes&nbsp;». The part was a new one for Bernhardt, premièred at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt on 20 May 1899 in a new, specially written 
<div class="dropleft"><img src="images/people/bernhardthamlet.jpg" height=270 width=200 border=2 alt="Sarah Bernhardt" title="Sarah Bernhardt">

prose adaptation. It was very much a Hamlet in the Continental European style, portraying the character as a lively, active prince 
rather than as the self-pitying melancholic  mother's boy of the typical anglo-saxon reading, so the duel scene was a natural one 
to pick. In England, Hamlet tended to be dressed in black; even in France he traditionally wore a black-plumed hat, a tradition 
Bernhardt chose to discard. The black plume was inextricably associated with the graveyard scene and, by wearing an unadorned hat, 
Bernhardt liberated her Hamlet from the introspection, pessimism and irresolution so often associated with the part. The British 
were of course scandalised by this "lack of proper philosophic melancholy" but the style became common in European performances 
and can be seen again in Asta Nielsen's wonderful 1921 film of the Shakespeare play. Nielsen, although in fact Danish, was often 
described as "the German Bernhardt." 
<br><br>
The scene also shows off to best advantage Bernhardt's legs in a costume deliberately designed to be more revealing in this respect than that of 
Pierre Magnier's as Laertes. As Victoria Duckett has pointed out in her excellent <i>Seeing Sarah Bernhardt: Performance and Silent 
Film</i> (2015), fencing was becoming a popular sport for women in France at this time. Nothing, according to <i>La Vie parisienne</i> 
in 1884, was "more efficient in combating this modern sickness of neurosis which they all more or less suffer, for accentuating the 
elegance of a slender waist, or for reducing the exaggerated opulence of the bodice."

There was also a scene from Molière's <i>Les Précieuses ridicules</i> with Benoît Constant Coquelin  <i>dit</i> Coquelin <i>aîné</i>  
(1841-1909). Coquelin, one of the most celebrated comic actors of the time, had first played the part of Mascarille, the servant 
who fancies himself a gentleman, in the Molière comedy at the Comédie française in Paris in 1875 but had also played the part 
more recently (1894) on Broadway at the Abbey's Theater (later known as the Knickerbocker Theater). Here he appears with Marguerite 
Esquilar (born 1870) in the role of Magdelon and Jeanne Kerwich (dates unknown) in the role of Cathos.

Coquelin <i>aîné</i> also performed the duel scene from Edmond Rostand's <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, his most famous role and a 
part he had created at the théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin (of which he was also the manager) at its première on 28 December 1897. 
We are extremely fortunate that this short film survives in colour and with its original sound-cylinder intact because these two 
appearances are the only time that Coquelin ever deigned to appear before a camera. Maxime Desjardins (1863-1936), who plays the 
other role (le Comte du Guiche) in this film, would go on to perform in some thirty films 1911-1932, while Kerwich, the <i>ingenue</i> 
whom Coquelin had recruited for his US tour, would go on to appear in three films, 1922-1930, including one of the first French 
"talkies" of the modern era, Ewald André Dupont and Jean Kemm's <i>Atlantis</i>/<i>Atlantic</i> (it was a Franco-British co-production) in 1930, 
where she and Desjardins, acting together on screen for the first and only time - here they in fact apepar in two different films - play a man and wife 
travelling on the doomed liner (a simulacrum of the Titanic)..

Arias from opera sung by popular stars were also a feature.  An air from <i>Roméo et Juliette</i> (1867) by Charles Gounod (1818-1893) 
and Jules Barbier and Michel Carré (libretto) was sung by a tenor from l'Opéra, Émile Cossira (1854-1823). With a certain inevitability 
it was the balcony scene, filmed in costume but without Juliet and with Cossira standing in front of a very modern-looking window. 
When the «&nbsp;Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp:» films, long thought lost, were rediscovered in the 1930s, those who recalled the events 
were invited to reminisce for the journal <i>L'Image</i>. Cossira's son, Henri recalled the awkwardness of the "playback" process, 
with the images seemingly being recorded immediately after the sound. He remembered his father spreading his arms wide to invoke 
the sun («&nbsp;Lève-toi, soleill&nbsp;») and singing aloud then remaining motionless to mime the words over again for the camera. 
Henri nevertheless judged that the synchronisation was "not too bad for the period".

<i>Invocation à Diane</i> («&nbsp;Ô toi qui prolongeas mes jours&nbsp;») from <i>Iphigénie en Tauride</i> by Nicolas François 
Guillard (libretto) and Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) was sung by mezzo-soprano Jeanne Hatto (1879-1958). This famous 
opera, based ultimately on the tragedy by Euripides, had first been performed, in the presence of Queen Marie-Antoinette, on 
18 May 1779, but was revived at the théâtre de la Renaissance in 1899  and at l'Opéra-Comique in 1900. Jeanne Hatto, just twenty-one, 
was a rising star at l'Opéra-Comique and in much demand; she would record the same song again for the Pathé Céleste, Pathé's prize-winning 
new phonograph, the following year. The <i>Annuaire des artistes</i> for 1902 described her in positively adulatory terms:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Mlle Jeanne Hatto est actuellement, à l'Opéra, l'incarnation le plus parfaite du soprano dramatique. Grande, d'allure superbe, 
avec une physionomie d'une mobilité extraordinaire, es yeux pétillants d'intelligence, et dans toute sa personne un air crâne 
qui en impose aux moins timides... elle est bien la femme pour personnifier, dans tout leur éclat, les héroïnes du répertoire 
lyrique.
<br><br>
Mlle Jeanne Hatto is at present, at l'Opéra, the mot perfect incarnation of the dramatic soprano. Tall, with a superb bearing, 
and a physiognomy of an extraordinary unique mobility, eyes flashing with intelligence, and in all her person a brave air that 
imposes itself on the less timid [they mean presumably the opposite]...she is indeed the woman to personify, in all their splendour, 
the heroines of the lyric repertoire.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
Henri Cossira in 1933 recalled an anecdote told by the artistic director, Marguerite Chenu, of something that occurred when the 
«&nbsp'Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» was on tour in 1901. The cylinder for this particular film had been mislaid and Chenu and Félix 
Mesguich (responsible for the projection) were obliged to show it "silent". Jeanne Hatto was, however, as it happened, herself in 
the audience, curious to see her own film, and Chenu held her breath and sent up a little prayer. Sure enough, at the appropriate 
moment, the song swelled loud and clear from the auditorium to the delight both of exhibitors and audience. It was one of those 
magical moments of "live" cinema, in a sense entirely lost to us today, that were always possible, whether by design or, as here, 
by happy accident, during what people obstinately persist in regarding as "the silent era".

In a rather different register, a trio from the popular operetta <i>La Poupée</i> (1896) by Maurice Ordonneau (libretto) and Edmond 
Audran (1842-1891) was sung by Belgian soprano Mariette Sully (1874-1940), who had created the title-role of Alesia on the stage, in 
company with MM. Fugère and Soums. This enormously popular operetta, which toured Europe for several years, is little known today 
but had an important influence upon the history of cinema. It has a story not dissimilar to that of the famous <i>conte</i> by E. T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), <i>Der Sandmann</i> (1816-1817) in which an 
automaton comes to life. The Hoffman tale, a classic forerunner of so much later <i>fantastique</i> literature and films, had 
already been adapted as a ballet, <i>Coppélia, ou la Fille aux yeux d'émail</i> (1870), by Charles Nuittier with choreography 
by Arthur Saint-Léon and music by Léo Delibes. Edmond Audran's operetta was a more light-hearted take on the same idea. It had 
opened at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Montparnasse, Paris on 31 October 1896, played in London in 1897 for a staggering 576 performances 
and been partly filmed (three scenes) in Rome, during its Italian run, in 1898 or 1899, by Lumière operators, probably on the 
initiative of one of Lumière's Italian «&nbsp;concessionnaires&nbsp;», magician and quick-change artiste Leopoldo Fregoli, who 
himself acted in it. Popular on the stage, such stories of dolls and automata that come to life have an even more striking analogical 
significance where cinema was concerned. The operetta would form the basis for a later Lumière film (1903), <i>Les Poupées</i> by 
Gaston Velle, would be filmed in Britain by in its entirety by Ward Meyrick Milton in 1920 and would also provide the inspiration 
for Ernst Lubitsch's comedy <i>Die Puppe</i> in 1919.

Soprano Émilie Mily-Meyer <i>dite</i> Mily-Meyer (1852-1952) was something of a hybrid, who lent her powerful voice both to innumerable 
operettas and to songs and sketches in the café concerts. The songs performed in 1900 came principally from a show called <i>Chansons 
en crinoline</i> that she performed with Désiré Pougaud (1866-1928) at the théâtre du Châtelet. There were to solo songs under 
this general title (<i>Fleur de l'âme</i>, a pleasant song but not, as is sometimes stated, a setting of a Victor Hugo poem, 
and <i>Pourquoi garder ton coeur&nbsp;?</i>), a very charming 1886 song by Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin (1821-1910). J. Leybach and Victor 
Wilder) but one them (it is not known which) had to be withdrawn after Mily-Meyer received complaints that a couplet was missing

Amongst the few films in the repertoire that are lost was the comic song, <i>J'ai perdu ma gigolette</I> sung by Louis Maurel 
(1859-1936), Maurel was a talented café concert perfomer but also an actor. He would make an appearance (as himself) in a Georges 
Méliès film in 1905 (<i>Le Raid Paris-Monte Carlo en deux heures</i>) wheer several other celbrities appear, including Litle Tich, 
he he would also play small parts in two films (1917 and 1935). His sister Rosine (1850-1919), also a singer and actress, appeared 
in three films 1913-1938. This comic song, written by Lucien Delormel (music), René Esse and Félix Mortreuil in 1892 and performed 
by Maurel at l'Alcazar, does itself survive in a later recording:

1916-1936,  performed four comic monologues, of which only two survive as films, <i>Le Maître de ballet</i> and <i>Une poule 
introduite dans un concert</i>. An original recording does exist for the first of these (here in its "unrestored" state).

Moy was able to surprise journalists in 1932, in replying to a question as to when he had made his first film by announcing that 
it had been in 1900 and a "talkie". He also explained the difficulties associated with the as yet unautomatised playback synchronisation. 
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Oui, j'ai tourné mon premier film sonore à l'Exposition de 1900. Ça s'appelait le «&nbsp;Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;». Il fallait 
s'habituer à parler en même temps que les images passaient. Quand on avait peu de choses à dire ça allait. Mais quand il fallait 
«&nbsp;synchroniser&nbsp;» (le mot n'existait pas encore) une longue tirade, ça n'allait plus du tout. 
<br><br>
Yes, I made my first sound film at the Exposition of 1900. It was called the «&nbsp;Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;». One had to get 
used to speaking at the same rhythm as the images that were shown. When one didn't have much to say, that was fine. But when one 
had to "synchronise" (the word didn't exist yet) a long tirade, that didn't work at all.
</blockquote>
<br><br>
The point made by Moy here explains a great deal about th repertire of the early "talkies" and why they almost invariably tended 
to privilege scenes of song and dance over the spoken word. The latter was simply far more diffuclt to synchronise.  Unsurprisingly 
the pioneers who ventured furthest with the spoken word were those, like Auguste Baron and later Henri Joly, who had devised an 
electrical device to create an automatic link between cinematograph and phonograph. Yet even when this process was generally automised 
(after 1907), the prejudice in favour of song and dance remained. It was perhaps the greatest weakness of these early "talkies'".
<br><br>
Essentially film-producers laboured under a misconception that it was these aspects of sound that must necessarily be most interesting 
to audiences.  It rarely occured to them - and it is perhaps counter-intuitive - that is was the perfectly ordinary spoken voice 
that they were principally interested in hearing. Even after 1927-1928, and despite the sensation caused by the famous incidental 
piece of well-worn Jolson stage-patter in the part-talkie <i>The Jazz Singer</i> ("you ain't heard nothing yet"), the misconcpetion 
persisted, as witness the excessive number of musicals produced in 1929-1930, many completely abysmal, which came close to making 
the public thoroughly sick of the "sound" revolution they had so enthusiastically welcomed.

More "spoken word" was provided by French <i>café concert</i> comedian and singer Paul Marsalés <i>dit</i> Polin (1863-1927) who 
performed a comic monologue, <i>Troupier pompette</i>. This genre, the «&nbsp;troupier comique&nbsp;» (the comic soldier), was a 
Polin speciality derived from the many comedies of military life written at the end of the nineteenth century by Georges Courteline 
(1858-1929), of which the most enduringly famous is  the 1886 comedy,  many times filmed over the years, <i>Les Gaietés de l'escadron</i>. 
In 1906 Polin would, along with fellow <i>caf'conc'</i> stars Félix Mayol and Dranem, record for both camera and phonograph for Alice 
Guy at Gaumont a whole series of «&nbsp;phonoscènes&nbsp;», twelve in all, in what amounted to a kind of "best of" compilation  («&nbsp;Polin 
dans ses créations&nbsp;») and an effective film-record of the singer's career.

Although the theatrical pieces produced for the were sensational enough, it must in some respects the remarkable dance-programme 
that was the highlight of the show. Like the great and the good of the legitimate thatre, the major dance-stars tended to turn their 
nose up at cinema; even Alice Guy at Gaumont, who showed a very particular interest in dance-films from an early stage in her career, 
had to rely largely on dancers of second  rank. Here Vrignault-Chenu has managed to assemble a really rather remarkable line-up 
of first-rate stars. The Italian Achille Viscusi (1869-1945) was not only a dancer but one of the most important choreographers 
and dance-teachers of the day, as was Jeanne Chasles (1869-1939), director of the Opéra comiique and later (1915) <i>professeur 
de danse</i> at the Paris Conservatoire. The Belgian Joseph Hansen (1842-1907), who choreographs one of the ballet-scenes, was 
had worked in London and Moscow before becoming Maître de ballet at the Palais Garnier (1887-1907). Michel Vasquez (1855-1903) was 
later Maìtre de Ballet at l'Opéra (1902-1903).

Christine Kerf (1875-1963), a star at l'Opéra Comique, would go on to appear in four films (1912-1922)
The Spanish dancer Rosetta Mauri Segura (1850-1923) was approaching the end of her career - she had actually retired from dancing 
in 1898 - but would teach at l'Opéra until 1920. She was succeeded in her roles by the Italian Italian Carlotta Zambelli (1875-1968), 
who would go on to be one of the was one of the great stars of l'Opéra, later known as «&nbsp;la Grande Mademoiselle&nbsp;», and who 
would leave in 1901 for a tour in St. Petersburg. Zambelli herself retired from dancing in 1930 but taught for a further twenty-five 
years, a career at l'Opéra of sixty-one years in all. According to dance-critic André Levinson (1887-1933), Zambelli exemplified 
«&nbsp;la ferveur italienne, tempérée par la mesure française&nbsp'» (Italian fervour tempered by French rhythm), which produced

A pupil, Lycette Darsonval (1912-1996), later herself directrice of the ballet de l'Opéra and of the ballet de Nice, once said 
of  «&nbsp;la Grande Mademoiselle&nbsp;» that she taught dancers «&nbsp;à n’être pas que des automates&nbsp; (not just to be automata) 
«&nbsp;mais à pénétrer aussi l’esprit d’un ballet, à observer les jeux de l’expression.&nbsp» (to penetrate the spirit of the 
ballet, to observe the play of expression).

The composer Camille Saint-Saaens (1835-1921) was another who stressed Zambelli's musicality, considering that, «&nbsp;au point de vue 
du rythme et de l’union profonde de la danse et de la musique (from the point of view of rhythm and the prodound harmony of dance and music), 
she was «&nbsp;la danseuse la plus étonnante que j’ai jamais vue&nbsp;» (te most astonishing dancer I ever saw). It was this aspect 
too that she herself chose to emphasise:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Il faut que l’artiste soit lui-même sensible à cette harmonie, c’est dire qu’une culture artistique est nécessaire. Particulièrement 
une grande culture musicale, sans laquelle la partie essentielle de ce tout complexe qu’est un ballet lui reste étrangère.

The artist must herself be sensible to this harmony; that is to say, that an artistic culture is necessary, particularly a great

Then the programme also included a performance by Cléo de Mérode who was something else again. Cléopâtre-Diane de Merode <i>dite</i> 
Cléo de Mérode (1875-1966) was not only a dancer but one of the acknowledged beauties of the period. Already by the age of twenty-three, 
in 1898, she had danced in the major works of Delibes (<i>Coppélia</i> and <i>Sylvia</i>), André Messager (<i>Les deux pigeons</i>), 
André Wormser (<i>L'Étoile</i>) and Gustave Charpentier (<i>Le Couronnement de la Muse</i> but had left l'Opéra in tht year to 
pursuse an independent career and her reputation as a dancer was often eclipsed by her mythic status as «&nbsp;reine de Beauté&nbsp;» 
established notably in a series of photographs by Paul Nadar (1856-1939) and Léopold-Émile Reutlinger (1863-1937), whose sumptious 
albums of photographs devoted to her gained an international reputation and spawned innumerable postcards. A great many of the photographs, 
including those of her in costume for both her Javanaise and Cambodian dances, were taken at precisely this time.

The scandal caused by a famous nude statue (1896) by Jean-Alexandre-Joseph Falguière (1831-1900), although Mérode denied ever having 
actuallyposed nude for it, the risqué performances at the Folies Bergère and the Alcazar, a far cry from le ballet de l'Opéra, 
the seemingly endless procession of male admirers, including most notoriously King Léopold II of the Belgians, with whom equally 
she denied ever having had an affair, as was popularly rumoured, all served to give her at this time a particularly sulphurous 
reputation on a par with that of the other celebrated dancer-courtesane of the Belle Époque, the Spaniard Caroline Otero (la belle 
Otéro) (1868-1965). That reputation, although it added to her celebrity, was mercilessly exploited by the caricaturists.
<br><br>
Yet, although the two were often popularly seen as rivals, they had in reality little in common. Unlike the flamboyant and opportunistic 
Otero, Cléo de Mérode took her dancing, even if it became of a distinctly eclectic nature, perfetly seriously and, again unlike 
Otero, always denied the imputations alleged by her detractors. As late s 1955 she would successfully sue Simone de Beavi=oir after 
the feminist had sourly referred to her as a «&nbsp;cocotte&nbsp:» in her 1949 book <i>Le Deuxième Sexe</i>.

Other dancers who appear, minor only by comparison with the big stars, were the three dancer-daughters of Louis-Amedée Mantes, 
Suxanne, Louise (1880-1999) and Blanche and Sandrine Violat, all of whom were regular dancers at ;'Opéra. The Mante sisters were 
known punningly as «&nbsp;Mantes-les-Jolies&nbsp;» because of the town of Mantes-la-Jolie, now a very unpretty-suburb in the 
Paris sprawl. Described as «&nbsp;danseuses mondaines&nbsp;», they would record several «&nbsp'phonoscènes&nbsp;» for Alice Guy 
at Gaumont in 1906.

As regards the content of the programme, it is as remarkable for what it does not contain as for what it does. There is for nstance 
no "Loïe Fuller" dance, what would later be though of as "modern dance". Wgen one considers that, apart from the British who seem 
at this time to have had little concept of dance beyond jigs and highland flings, virtually every film-maker of the period from 
Mx Skladanowky in Germany to Lumière, Pathé, Demenÿ and later Guy for Gaumont, Méliès, Parnaland, Joly, Léar and Pirou, Mendel, 
Baron, Nadar, De Bedts and, across the Atlantic, Edison, Mutoscope, Lunin and Selig, there is not a single one that did not jump 
on the bandwagon of Fuller's surprise success at the Folies bergère and produce at least one example of some dancer or other - never 
Fuller herself - twirling around in a furry of bedsheets. Given the constant parade of such Fuller dance-alikes, the omission here 
is very striking and must quite clearly be the result of a deliberate decision not to include such a film.
<br><br>
Then again, although the programme is, as we shall see, far from austere or lacking in passion and sensuousness, and contains much 
exotic and "orientalist" material, there are no belly-dances or spear-waving Ashanti. There are no Barrison sister, the "wikedest 
girls in the world" offering to show the audience their pussies; they had kittens strapped int their knickers. There are not even 
any of the popular novelty dances (the cakewalk the kickapoo, the tough dance, the apache dance, the shimmy), that were beginning 
to become popular in the US and would in time come to dominate the dance-repertoire of films. Instead what we have is a high-quality 
programme of an interesting variety but of a certain artistic seriousness that is enormously to the credit of Marguerite Vrignault-Chenu, 
herself a dancer, as artistic director. It is also in looking at the dance-programme that one appreciates fully the way that the 
«&nbsp;Phono-cinéma-théâtre&nbsp;» situated itself at the heart of the Paris Exposition as a whole and deveoped many of its most 
important themes and motifs.
<br><br> 
If the concept of "modern dance" was too novel or, more probably, just too amateurish to merit inclusion, the other important tendency 
of the period, what was known as the "cosmopolitan" dance, is very strongly represented. This too was ubiquitous and could have its 
distinctly trivial side. Take for instance one of the least of the glitterati to appear in the show, Sandrine Violat - we do not know her dates; we do not 
even know her first name. She was however a regular performer at l'Opéra and later at the Palais Garnier. 
<br><br>
TThe Palais de la Danse 
advertised itself at this time as providing "a history of the dance in ballets" with "dances from all countries".

This cosmopolitanism was in the image of the times. It reflected in part the huge ineterest in the cultures of other lands and 
of other peoples that had burgeoned as a result of colonial expansion and, just as importantly, of the massive growth in tourism. 
It was in the image too of the International Expositions.
Finally it was also in the image of the dancers themselves who were themselves of different nationalities and who not only 
toured frequently (especially to Moscow and St. Petersburg which had become the most important centers of dance outside Paris) 
but also worked abroad. Achille Viscusi wuld spend most of his career in a country he knew as Bohemia when he first went there 
a artistic director of the in 1900 and as Czechosloakia when he worked there during the inter-war years, years in which the country 
was not only one of the most prosperous in Europe, and indeed the world, as any Czech or Slovak will proudly tell you, but was 
also one of the most culturally dynamic.

The <i>Ballet de Terpsichore (Un Mariage aux Flambeaux)</i>, danced by Christine Kerf and Achille Viscusi of 
the Palais de la Danse. <i>Terpsichore</i> was a new one-act ballet produced in 1900 with music by Léo Pouget (1875-1930) and 
a libretto by Adolphe Thalasso (1858-1919), choreographed by Mariquita and, in the original production, with an orchestra directed 
by Félix Desgranges. 
<br><br>
Marie-Thérèse Gamalery <i>dite</i> Madame Mariquita (1841-1922) was an Algerian-born dancer of Spanish descent who had a remarkably 
varied career and was quite possibly the most famous <i>maîtresse de ballet</i> of the Belle Époque. She had made her début at the Funambules, in the dingy boulevard 
du Temple (nicknamed «&nbsp;boulevard du crime&nbsp;», later famous as the setting for Marcel Carné's <i>Les Enfants du paradis</i>, 
then worked her way up successively to théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens, the Teatro Variedades in Madrid (where she presumably learned 
the flamenco), théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin (whose director, Marc Fournier, she married). By 1871 she was <i>maîtresse de 
ballet</i> at the Folies bergère but continued to dance herself in theatres of all kinds (Châtelet, Gaîté, Bouffes-Parisiens, 
Variétés, Porte Saint-Martin, the London Lyceum, the théâtre Lafayette in Rouen, thr Skating in la rue Blanche, etc.). <i>Maîtresse 
de ballet</i> at l'Opéra Comique (1898-1920), in addition to her work at the Folies, she was also director of choreography of the 
Palais de la Danse at the 1900 Exposition. This did not prevent her from also dancing herself from time to time at «&nbsp;La Feria&nbsp;» 
restaurant in the Spanish Pavilion in the Rue des Nations.

characters based on <i>Carmen</i>, Kerf as «&nbsp;la cigarrera&nbsp;» and Viscusi as a matador while the dance itself was a flamenco. 
<i>Le Matin</i>, which had reviewed the stage-show on 27 May 1900, singled Kerf out for praise for «&nbsp;l'élégance et la fureur&nbsp;» 
of her performance, describing her as «&nbsp;une danseuse étonnante&nbsp;». An extened article by critic Gabriel 
Pitté consecrated to <i>Terpsichore</i> in <i>La Grande Vue</i> provides a fuller account:

<blockquote>
Tout en satin blanc, une fabricante de cigares se penche, brille, tourbillonne et s'enflamme, poursuivie et hantée par un torero 
agile, un torero tout en satin blanc comme elle et qui, vertigineux, plein de désir passionné, tremble frénétiquement sous ses 
jupes un tambourin tintant. Presque accroupi sous ses pas, on dirait qu'il infuse la montée de son désir ardent&nbsp;: la fabricante 
de cigares, après chaque pause, se penche de plus en plus abandonnée, puis se lève et repart, volant au-delà. Six Andalouses vêtues 
de longs châles, la fleur de la grenade à l'oreille, rampent dans leur ombre, les suivent pas à pas, enivrant le couple avec un

tumulte déchaîné d'olés, de tambourins et de gais castagnettes&nbsp;: au fond, au fond des arches maures, les guitares étincelantes 
et les torches qui rougissent, saignent dans le bleu de la nuit&nbsp;: c'est toute l'Espagne et tout Grenade.
<br><br>
All white satin, a cigar maker leans, shines, swirls and flames, pursued and haunted by an agile bullfighter, a bullfighter, all 
white satin like her. who, dizzyingly, full of passionate desire, frantically shakes beneath her skirts a tinkling tambourine. 
Almost crouching under her feet, he could be said to be infusing the mounting ardour of his desire: the cigar maker, after each 
pause, inclines in a more abandoned, then gets up and leaves, flying away. Six Andalusian girls dressed in long shawls, with 
pomegranate flowers in their ears, creep in their shadow, following them step by step, intoxicating the couple with a raging 
tumult of olés, tambourines and cheerful castanets: in the background, behind the Moorish arches, the jangle of guitars, and 
the glowing torches that bleed in the blue of the night: it is all Spain and all Granada.

<br><br>
For the «&nbsp;Phono-cinéma-théâtre&nbsp;» version it would seem from Pitté's account that the six Andalusian dancers were replaced 
by an entire <i>corps de ballet</i> specially imported from Granada so that «&nbsp;leurs coutumes quelque ... dangereuses&nbsp;» (their 
somwhat...risqué costumes) «&nbsp;pour être exposés avec toute la fougue de la jeunesse devant les regards excités d'un public 
cosmopolite&nbsp;» (could be displayed with all the élan of youth, before the excited regard of a cosmopolitan public). While this 
show in full could also be seen live at the Palais de Danse in the Rue de Paris,

<i>Le Cid</i> was a four-act opera rather than a ballet, with music by Jules Massenet (1842-1912) and a libretto by Louis Gallet, 
Édouard Blau and Adolphe d'Ennery based on the 1636 play by Jean Racine, but it gives a very large place to dance, with an elborate 
ballet suite in Act II. There is in fact no «&nbsp;habanera&nbsp;» but rather a «&nbsp;Castillane&nbsp;», followed by an «&nbsp;Andalouse&nbsp;», 
an «&nbsp;aragonaise&nbsp;», an «&nbsp;aubade&nbsp;», a «&nbsp;Catalane&nbsp;», a «&nbsp;Madrilène&nbsp;» and a a «&nbsp;Navarrosie&nbsp;», 
the object being in other words to represent all the different regions of Spain. First produced by the Opéra comique, and the ballet 
suite  had been specially created by Massenet for the Spanish <i>prima ballerina</i> Rosita Mauri, who was now, almost symbolically, 
passing on her roles to Carlotta Zambelli, What Zambelli and Michel Vasquez dance on film is probably the «&nbsp;Catalane&nbsp;», 
since the «&nbsp;habanera&nbsp;», although, as its name implies, a Cuban dance in origin, was particularly associated with Catalonia.
<br><br>
the Kerf-Viscusi flamenco and the Zambelli-Vasquez habanera or catalane constituted only a small part of the Spanish dance available 
at the Exposition. An Andalouisan dance-troupe could also be seen in <i>L’Andalousie au temps des Maures</i> at the Trocadéro while other 
Spanish dancers featured in the <i>Panorama de La Tour de Monde</i> at the Théâtre Exotique in the Champ-de-Mars, at the «&nbsp;La Feria&nbsp;» 
restaurant in the Spanish Pavilion in the Rue des Nations and, from time to time, at the Pavillon Bleu in the shadow of the Tour Eiffel. 
There was apparently even a spectacle <i>Las sevillanas</i> being performed in the reconstructed «&nbsp;Vieux Paris&nbsp;» along the banks of the Seine.

Flamenco had first come to Paris in 1879 when the troupe of Antonio Calzadilla performed at the Hippodrome in December(and subsequently 
at various other Paris theatres during 1880) and Spanish popular music continued to remain popular. It had already featured strongly 
in the 1889 Paris Exposition, following as it did hard on the heels of Spain's own first international Exposition, the 1888 Exposition 
in Barcelona. Bizet's <i>Carmen</i> celebrated its four hundredth performance at l'Opéra comique that year and Emmanuel Chabrier's rhapsody 
for orchestr, <i>España</i>, was all the rage in the Parisian concert-halls.

«&nbsp;Aimez-vous l'espagnol;&nbsp:?&nbsp;» became a popular cachphrase.The critic and folk-music specialist Julien Thiersot wrote 
in his <i>Promenades musicales à l'Ezposition</i>:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Aimez-vous l'espagnol&nbsp;? On en a mis partout. Course de taureaux à droite, course de taureaux à gauche&nbsp;; société chorale 
espagnole par-ci, soirées espagnoles par-là&nbsp;; au Cirque d'hiver grandes fêtes espagnoles, orchestre, danse, estudiantine&nbsp;

Do you love things Spanish? They have put them everywhere. Bullfights to the right, bullfights to the eft. Spanish choral society 
this way, Spanish evenings that way. At the Cirque d'hiver big Spanish fiestas, orchestra, dance, student groups. Spain goes too far,

There was a certain continuity between the Expositions universelles of 1889 and 1900. If both represented shining examples of modernity 
and prgress (symbolised by «&nbsp;La Galerie des machines&nbspl» in 1889 and by the omnipresence of electicity - «&nbsp;la fée électricté&nbspl» 
as "she" is called in French - at the 1900 Exposition, both also sought to place that modernity and progres within a larger context 
of human diversity and human evolution. This conveniently allowed for a flamboyant display at both Expositions of France's colonial 
grandeur, much expanded towards the turn of the century at the expense of the few remaining independent countries of Africa and 
South-East Asia. At a period when evolutionary theory was heavily impregnated with eugenics, this inevitably implied, in general 
terms, a display of the coloniser's innate superiority over the relatively primitive peoples colonised,envisaged as belonging to 
earlier stages of human development.

The 1889 Exposition was the first to devote itself on a large scale to its «&nbsp;section coloniale&nbsp;» with the «&nbsp;pavillons 
coloniaux&nbsp;» and their adjacent side-shows and <i>cafés-concerts</i> occupiying an area of 28,850 square metres pn the Esplanade 
des Invalides, 10,646 square metres of which consisted of the «&nbsp;pavillons&nbsp;» and «&nbsp;villages&nbsp;», a further 6,300 and 
5,300 square metres, respectively, to the «&nbsp;grandes expositions&nbs[;» of Algeria and Tunisia. Within this area, apart from various 
kiosks dispensing snacls, waffles and ice-creams, there was also an annamite restaurant (130 square metres), a <i>créole</i> restaurant 
(100 square metres(, an algerian <i>café-concert<i>, a «&nbsp;café maure&nbsp;», with a «&nbsp;café-restaurant javanais&nbsp;» situated 
to the south pf the area reserved for the French colonies in the «&nbsp;kampong javanais&nbsp;» of the Duch East Indies.

In 1900 the «&nbsp;section coloniale&nbsp;», on the hill and gardens of the Palais du Trocadéro, covered an area of 33,949 square 
metres (buildings) and a further 16,254 square metres (open spaces). There was a large two-storey algeran restaurant, a <i>café maure</i> 
and various bars wheer one could taste <i>eau-de-vie</i> from the Indian Ocean island of Réunion, rum from Martinique, cofee from 
Nouvelle-Calédonie and so on.
<br><br>
Much of the attention focused on the more exotic aspect of these Expositions has, quite rightly, seen them within the vontext of 
"orientalism", a term that, although it is a much older usage, has become indeliliby associated in modern times with the 1970 book 
of that title by Palestinian scholar Edward Wadie Said (1935-2003). Said, however, was using the term within a very political sepcific 
context and never intended it to become the rather glib rallying-cry for a generalised "anti-colonialism" that contents itself with 
for the most part with the ragbag of simplistic half-truths that comprise what is called "post-olonial discourse". "Orientalism", 
like any popular view of other cultures or of other periods of history, is certainly a form of mythologising but it is not part 
of a coherent "project" (to borrow from the heavy-handed, ahistorical newspeak of the "social sciences") nor is it one homogeneous 
phenomenon.
<br><br> 
Japanese art was in high esteem in France at this time. The Japanse &nbsp;ukiyo-e&nbsp;» (floating world) art movement that had 
flourished under the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868) was an important influence on the Impressionists and other contemporary French 
painters.  High prices were paid for very collectable works by Outamaro and Hokousai to whom the writer and critic Edmond de Goncourt 
(182201896) had devoted books in 1891 and 1896. In 1889 <i>Le Guide Bleu du Figaro et du Petit Journal</i> enthused over the <i>Pavillon 
japonais</i> - «&nbsp;des soieries, des porcelaines, des cloisonnées, des laques, des scultures. Mille richesses arrêtent retiennent&nbsp;» 
(a thousand riches retain the attention) and the art historian Raymond Koechlin (1860-1931), visting the <i>pavillon japonais</i> 
in 1900, regretted the "egotistical classicism" of certain Europeans that was all that prevented Japanese (and for that matter Chinese) 
art from taking the place alongside European art which was rightfully theirs.
<br><br>
French musicians influenced by Japan included Camille Saint-Saëns (1831-1921) whose opera <i>La Princesse jaune</i> with a libretto 
by Louis Gallet (1835-1898) had appeared in 1872 at l'Opéra comqique. <i>Le Rêve</i> (1890) was a ballet with music by Léon Gastinel 
(1823-1906), a libretto by Edward Blau and wih choreography by Joseph Hansen. It contained, in the second act, a pantomime, <i>Mikagouva</i>, 
also known as «&nbsp;le pas de la robe de chambre&nbsp:», which had been specially written for Rosita Mauri who had come out of 
retirement to perform it and here danced it yet again, ten years later, for the camera of Clément-Maurice. To judge from the critical 
notices, it proved one of her greatest triumphs.

According to one critic who witnessed the original production, Mauri plays a woman who, although supposedly Japanese - <i>la gitanilla 
de Tokio</i> (the little gypsy or Tokyo), according to one critic - has the rather unJapanese name of Dalta and who has been given her 
first long dress. sewn for her by the fairies, along with a sacred fan and, after a suitable swish of the latter, to an accompaniment 
of flute and harp, she «&nbsp;parcourt le théâtre avec une joie enfantine&nbsp;» (runs through the theatre with a childish joy), stopping from time to time to admire herself 
in her dress, then proceeding triumphantly on her way. She was «&nbsp;bissée&nbsp;» (called on to perform an encore) and, according 
to the critic, they would have liked to have «&nbsp;trissée&nbsp;» (called for yet another encore), so delightful was the dance - 
«&nbsp;un véritable petit trouvail&nbsp;» (a real little find). Another critic (<i>Le Radical</i>) described it as «&nbsp;un bijou 
choréographique et musical&nbsp;» (a choreographic and musical jewel), Another (<i>Le Gaulois</i> enthused at greater length:
<br><br>
<blockquote>
Mlle. Mauri y monte plus que jamais de fine et légère fantaisie, d'art délicat, de virtuosité spirituelle, nuancée de ci de là, 
de tendresses et de langoureux abandons.. J'ai parlé de Mlle, Mauri qui mime et danse le rôle de Dalta. Cette denseuse exquise 
n'a jamais été plus en verve. Elle a des hardiesses de légèreté qui lui sont toute naturelles. Quand l'on le revêt, au second 
acte, de l'ample robe des déesses, et que l'on confie ;'éventail sacré, elle marque des étonnements ravis, elle dégage une séduction 
étrange, et rien de plus gracieusement fantasque que la façon dont elle rejette derrière elle, en dansant, la draperie surabondante. 
...Mlle. Mauri plaît par la caractère spontané de son talent&nbsp; elle semble touhours danser et mimer improvisant, et toujours 
elle est vive, amusante, et ausi vraie que le comporte son art. Parfois, une nuance de sensibilité colore son caprice. Et le charme 
est autant plus vivant qu'il est plus francheent rythmique sous la constante liberté des mouvements.

At the other extreme of the (very broadly) orientalist register wre the peoples of sub-Saharan Africa or Oceania. Much of the 
indignation of "post-colonialists" has focused on the phenomenon of the «&nbsp;village nègre&nbsp;», not new in 1900 nor even 
in 1889, but incorporated really for the first time at the earlier date into the wider 
In 1889 four hundred 
<br><br>
Between these two extremes came the very different, and very differently percieved, colonial worlds of North Afica (the Maghreb 
and Egypt),dominantly arab in culture, and that of the far East, represented by the French colonies of Annam and Cambodia (French 
Indo-China) and, a slightly anomalous honorary presence at both Expositions, Java in the Dutch East Indies. It was in the area 
devoted to the former that, in 1889, one found the notorious 
The foreign pavilions were to be found in 1889 on the Esplanade des Invalides. The Annamite Theatre was to the left of the central 
avenue in the middle of the Esplanade, while the «&nbsp;kampong javanais&nbsp;» was near the end of the Esplanade. The theatre 
showed long dramatised epics with improvised dialogue, accompanied by an orchestra of six musicians, five grouped around the perfomers 
while the sixth remained in the background, punctuating the performance from time to time on a drum. In the Javanese pavilion, a 
village had been set up. Here sixty Javanese people went about their daily tasks of cooking, making batiks and, most importantly, 
making music and dancing. A second orchestra played marching music used to accompany the performers when they processed through 
the compound.
<br><br> 
In 1900, the Javanese orchestra, the «&nbsp;gamelan-goedjin&nbsp;», was again present to accompany the dances, music, according to Émile 
Verhaeren "like flowing water" that "animates these dances, these calm, chaste and tranquil dances. it has neither beginning nor 
end; one would say that it forms part of the unceasing movement of the universe". In respect both of exoticism and of authenticity 
(however judged), the Javanese dancers rivalled the Spanish <i>gitanes</i> as the stars of the.Exposition.
<br><br>
It is symptomatic of the much greater respect showed to the Indianised culture of South-East Asis, that the Cambodian dancers, 
associated with the court of King Sihanouk

Edmond de Goncourt, a notable cynic who neverthless attended the Exposition assiduously, found the Cambodian display particularly 
disquieting:
<blockquote>
À l’Exposition. Antiquités cambodgiennes. Ces monstres à bec d’oiseau, qui ont l’air d’appartenir à une période d’êtres plésiosauriques, 
ces sphinx en forme de cynocéphales, ces éléphants à l’aspect d’énormes colimaçons, ces griffons qui semblent les féroces paraphes d’un 
calligraphe géant en délire &nbsp; Et au milieu de l’ornementation de queues de paon, d’yeux de plumage, ces attelées d’hommes à la pantomime 
inquiétante, et ces danseuses, aux formes de fœtus, coiffées de tiares, au rire héliogabalesque. Oh ! ce rire dans ces bouches bordées de 
lèvres, comme on en voit dans les masques antiques, et encore ces têtes avec des oreilles semblables à des ailes de chauve-souris, et avec 
l’ombre endormie et heureuse qu’elles ont sous leurs paupières fermées, et avec l’épatement sensuel, et avec la léthargie jouisseuse d’un 
sommeillant en une pollution nocturne...Tout ce monde de pierre a quelque chose d’hallucinatoire qui vous retire de votre temps et de votre 
humanité.
</blockquote>
Exotic dance.......
<br><br>
The composer Claude Debussy, who first encountered Javanese music at the 1889 Exposition and was hugely influenced by it, was of 
quite a different opinion. In 1913 he would write:
<blockquote>
Il y a eu, il y a même encore, malgré les désordres qu'apporte la civilisation, de charmants petits peuples qui apprirent la musique aussi simplement qu'on apprend à respirer. Leur conservatoire c'est : le rythme étemel de la mer, le vent dans les feuilles, et mille petits bruits qu'ils écoutèrent avec soin, sans jamais regarder dans d'arbitraires traités. Leurs traditions n'existent que dans de très vieilles chansons, mêlées de danses, où chacun, siècle sur siècle, apporta sa respectueuse contribution. Cependant, la musique javanaise observe un contrepoint auprès duquel celui de Palestrina n'est qu'un jeu d'enfant. Et si l'on écoute, sans parti pris européen, le charme de leur
« percussion », on est bien obligé de constater que la nôtre n'est qu'un bruit barbare de cirque forain.
<br><br>
...] There have been, and they still exist, despite the disorders which civilisation brings in its train, charming little peoples who learned music as simply as one learns to breathe. Their conservatoire is the eternal rhythm of the sea, the wind in the leaves, the thousand little noises which they listen to carefully, without ever consulting arbitrary treatises. Their traditions only exist in very old songs and dances to which each one of them, throughout the centuries, brought his respectful contribution. Nevertheless, Javanese music is characterized by an art of counterpoint compared to which that of Palestrina is mere child's play. And if we listen, forgetting our European prejudices, to the charm of their «percussion» we are forced to admit that ours sounds like the barbarous noise of a travelling circus. 
</blockquote>
Perhaps the most eloquent testimony concerning the Javanese dance comes from the pen and brush of the US artist John Singer Sargent
<br><br>
As Van Troi Tran points out in his excellent doctoral thesis <i>Manger et boire aux Expositions universelles de 1889 et 1900</i> 
(2010), the "cosmopolitanism" of the Expositions (a phenomenon not dissimilar to that which we now dub "globalisation") really took 
the form, as arguably it still does, «&nbsp;d'un collage et d'une superposition de représentations locales, régionales, nationales 
et coloniales&nbsp;» (a collage or superimposition of representations of the local, national and colonial). The resulting patchwork 
was genuine enough in its way (as genuine as such aspirations towards "universality" ever are or ever can be). It served the interests 
certainly, <i>inter alia</i> of colonial expansionism, but also, on a more profound level, a more long-term process
a srt of "collage

If the Paris Exposition of 1900, like its various predecessors, exalted an image of the cosmpopolitan, it also, paradoxically, 
encouraged the opposite tendency, a kind of politics of nostalgia. If the Expositions reconstructed buildings and scenes associated 
with different countries, peoples and cultures, they also attempted to reconstruct the past. In 1900 the quais de la Seine wre 
home to «&nbsp;Le Vieux Paris&nbsp;», conceived by the historian Albert Roblida, a meticulous reconstruction of Paris at different 
historical periods which extended over an area of 6500 metres where various spectacles were mounted and where a "population", dressed 
in costumes of the different epochs, was kept in a constant state of animation throughout the Exposition.

Another show that had been specially prepared for the 1900 Exposition was <i>Danses de naguère et de jadis</i>, with a composite 
score by Paul Vidal (1863-1931), based on twenty-eight airs from the past (ranging from works by Rameau to those of the contemorary 
composer André Wormser). Produced by the opera-singer and theatre director Pierre Samson Gailhard <dit> Pedro Gailhard (1848-1914) 
and performed once again by the ballet de l'Opéra where the composer was «&nbsp;directeur de chant&nbsp;» (1892-1905) and later 
«&nbsp;chef d'orchestre&nbsp;» (1906), described at the time as «&nbsp;maître de l'art de Terpsichore&nbps;». The show was also 
the culmination of a whole process of careful research concerning ancient Greek orchestration conducted by the choreographers 
Laure Françoise Pointet <i>dite</i>> Laure Fonta (1845-1915) and Joseph Hansen.An extract from this entertainment, The Greek dances 
in the show were a notable success. A dance of priestesses was performed to music by Paul Véronge de la Nux (1853-1928), «&nbsp;chef 
de chant" at Sarah Bernhardt's Théâtre de la Renaissance, set by Louis-Albert Bourgault-Ducoudray (1840-1910), composer, conductor,  
champion of the folk-music of his native Brittany and one of Frace's foremost experts on folk-music, and sung by Jeanne Julia Regnault 
<i>dite</i> Julia Bartet (1854-1941), star of the Comédie française and another, along with Réjane and Bernhardt, of the great actresses 
of the day. Unlike her <i>consoeurs</i>, Bartet never appeared in a film. Then the Italian dancer Emma Sandrini (1871-1927) performed 
a more dramatic dance to the music of <i>Les Troyens à Carthage</i> (1863) by Hector Berlioz (1803-1969).Amongst the supporting cast, 
Sandrine Violat appears as one of the accompanying fauns (the other is Jeanne Régnier). This was followed by a «&nbsp;danse des 
crotales&nbsp;» (antique cymbals) followed by a further dance (priestesses and fauns) to the potry of Pierre-Barthélemy Gheusi (1865-1943), 
Toulousain writer and journalist with an interest in the medieval heretics of that region, popularly known as «&nbsp;cathares&nbsp;», 
set to the music of Ernest Guiraud (1837-1932). Guiraud, best known tody as the compor of the famous <i>récitatifs</i> for Bizet's 
<i>Carmen</i> and for his completion of the orchestration for Offenbach's <i>Contes d'Hofmann</i>, was a founder-member of the Société 
Nationale de Musique (1871), motto «&nbsp;Ars gallica&nbsp;»".which aimed to promote the cause of French music in conrsat to the German 
tradition, "to spread the gospel of French music and to make known the works of living French composers" and was also the author of 
a highly-respected scholarly treatise on instrumentation (1891). 
<br><br>
One sees in this extraordinary <i>pot-pourri</i>, a really rather remarkable combination of the scholarly and the dilettante, 
the fascination with both an imagined past and an imagined present, interests, variously rpresenetd that are local, national 
and cosmopolitan. Once aagin it is the effect of a collage or patchwork, in the image of the Expositions' own aspirations to

<i>La Gavotte</i> from this same show, described as «&nbsp;une danse ancienne&nbsp;» and featuring Cléo de Mérode in fact had music by a contemporary 
composer Marcel Samuel-Rousseau. It could be seen on film at «&nbsp;Le Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» but could have also been seen 
elsewhere, like <i>Terpsichore</i>, live as part of the entire spectacle. It was performed at two of the great landmark-buildings 
of the Exposition, first performed on 10 August 1900 at the Palais de l'Elysée (entirely rebuilt in the course of the two Paris 
Expositions of 1889 and 1900 in place of the Palais de l'Industrie of 1855 as «&nbsp;le Grand Palais des Beaux Arts et des arts 
décoratifs&nbsp;» and «&nbsp;le Petit Palais de l'art français&nbsp;» and then on 11 November 1900 at the Palais du Trocadéro 
(originally built for the Exposition of 1878 but a centrepiece of the 1900 Exposition where it overlooked the colonial pavilions 
constructed in the surrounding gardens).

The scholarly choreographer Laure Fonte had also worked on French dances of the seventeenth and eighteenth centruy and written 
an important book on the subject, <i>Les Danses de nos pères</i> (The Dances of our Fathers), which appeared at around this time.
<br><br>
<br><br>
Dances included were <i>Danse des Incroyables</i>, <i>Danse Directoire</i> and <i>Danses slaves</i> (all with music cellist, panist and 
composer William (1861-1933)
Marie), the first danced by Blanche and Louise Mante of l’Opéra, the second by Jeanne Chasles of l’Opéra-Comique and Achille Viscusi 
of the Palais de la Danse, <i>Danse javanaise</i>, danced by Cléo de Mérode,  

The dancer and choreographer Jeanne Chasles from l’Opéra-Comique appeared in a very <i>mouvementée</i> dance, <i>Le Pas du petit 
faune</i> from <i>Le Cygne</i> 

and  <i>Le Pas de la Sabotière</i> from the ballet <I>La Korrigane</i> (1884) by François Coppée and Louis Mérante with music by Charles-Marie Widor (1844-1937) was danced by Rosita Mauri 
and two of the Mantes sisters (Violat and Suzanne)

Zambelli also danced <i>La Pizzicati</i> from <i>Sylvia ou la Nymphe de Diane</i> (1876) by Jules Barbier and Jacques de Reinach 
with music by Léo Délibes (1836-1891). Her performance of <i>La Pizzicata</i>, which sje psobily also dances in the 1808 film of 
her by Paul Nadar, son of the great photographer, remained one of her most famous pieces. The French ballerine Yvette Chauviré (1917-2018), 
who had been taught by Zambelli and was herself famous for her performances of <i>Giselle</i> (1841), a part inherited from Zambelli 
and Michel Fokine's <i>La Mort d'un cygne</i> (1907), described the technique of Zambeli as «&nbsp;éblouissante&mbsp;» (stunning). 
«&nbsp;Dans Sylvia, elle bissait toujours les célèbres pizzicati&nbsp;»  (she was always called on to perform an encore of the 
famous <i>Pizzicati</i>). «&nbsp;Elle était distinguée, sans une once de vulgarité.&nbsp;» (she was distinguished witout an ounce 
of vulgarity).  
<br><br>
Two of the Mantes sisters (Blanche 
and Louise) also performed a dance to a recording of medieval carols, <i>Caroles du Moyen Age</i> set by William Marie but this 
is one of the very few films that remains lost.

The comedy duo from the Nouveau Cirque, Foottit and Chocolat perform two of their best-loved sketches, <i>Les Échasses</i> and 
<i>Guillaume Tell</i>. The British-born clown George Foottit (1884-1921) and the his Cuban-born black partner CHocolat, whose real 
name was Rafael or Raphaël (sometime adopting the surname Padilla or de Leios), were at the height of their popularity at this 
time. <i>Guillaume Tell</i> was also among six of their sketches filmed the same year by Lumière operators. There has been a recent 
fictionalised film biography of the Cuban, <i>Chocolat</i> (2016) with Omar Sy in the title role and James Thierée (a grandson of 
Charles Chaplin) playing George Foottit.
<br><br>
More comedy was provided by another British entertainer, hugely popular in France, Harry Relph known as Little Tich (1867-1928) 
who performed the "big boots" act for which he was most famous, as well as performing a <i>danse espagnole</i> (Spanish dance).  
Little Tich made quite frequent film appearances at this period but some of these later films were in fact made by a French imitator 
who called himself «&nbsp;Little Pich&nbsp;». Here, at any rate we are certain that we have the genuine article. The great French 
<i>cinéaste</i> Jacques Tati once described the "big boots" film as «&nbsp;la base de tout ce qui a été réalisé dans la comédie sur 
l'écran&nbsp;»  (the basis for all that has been achieved in screen comedy).

Mason and Forbes, described as <i>excentrics américains</i> performed a comic pantomime sketch in a photographer's studio, <i>Scène 
chez le photographe</i>. Even <i>scènes grivoises</i> were not neglected, as the female impersonator Brunin 
(1859-1933) from Les Ambassadeurs peformed his parody of the Famous Willy Louise <i>La Coucher de la mariée</i> entitled <i>Déshabillé 
de la mariée</i>.
<br><br>
<br><br>
«&nbsp:Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre&nbsp;» opened on 28 March 1900 and was an immediate success with the critics. According to <i>Le Figaro</i>:
<blockquote>
Grâce à la combinaison complète et absolue de ces deux merveilles, le phonographe et le cinématographe, on est arrivé à un résultat 
d’une rare perfection, dont il faut féliciter MM. Clément Maurice et Lioret...Quant au phonographe, c’est également une pure merveille

The public itself, unfortunately, was more reticent, the attendance was disappointing and the takings wer less than expected, 
but the films, or a selection of them, continued to be exhibited in Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, England, Germany. Austria and Italy, 
and finally in 1901 at the Isola Brothers' Olympia theatre in Paris, the former Lumière operator Félix Mesguich apparently being 
the operator responsible for the touring version. The Société Phono-Cinéma-Théâtre was finally dissolved on 26 November 1901. 
Virtually the entire collection of films, rediscovered in 1961, with some newly-discovered additions from other sources, was 
restored by the Cinémathèque française in 2010-2012.

Pathé frères was a manufacturer of phonographs and phonograph cylinders as well as films with a factory in Chatou, 28 kilometres 
east of Vincennes, in what is now the <i>département</i> of the Yvelines, devoted to their manufacture. The photograph below is 
from a later period, but it was a major operation from the outset, producing betwen 10,000 and 12,000 cyclinders a day and employing 
between 2,000-3000 people by 1905. In preparation for the Exposition, a dynamic new administrator called Ivatta was appointed,

cabaret singer Charlus, who had been persuaded to interrupt his <i>café-concert</i> career to work for Pathé, was given the post 
of «&nbsp;directeur artistique&nbsp;» and a whole range of now phongraphs with fancy names («&nbsp;Le Gaulois&nbsp;», «&nbsp;Le Coquet&nbsp;», 
«&nbsp;Le Duplex&nbsp;» and «&nbsp;Le Céleste&nbsp;» were made ready, but the man principally responsible for the preparations 
was an employee in the <i>phonographe</i> department called Ferdinand Zecca. The display at the Exposition was a great success 
(«&nbsp;Le Gaulois&nbsp;» gained Pathé «&nbsp;Le Grand Prix&nbsp;»).
<br><br>
Ferdinand Louis Zecca (1864-1947) was an actor in the café-concerts but had also done voice-recordings for Pathé. It was his work 
for the 1900 Exposition that established him in a career with the firm and lad to his becoming the most important director over 
during the next decade. Louis Napoéon Defer <i>dit</i> Charlus was a performer at the café-concert L'Époque, known primarily as 
an imitator of the major caf'conc' star of la belle époque, Paulus (1857-1908). As a phonograph recodist, Charlus became so prolific 
during his time with Pathé that he was nicknamed the «&nbsp;forçat du gramophone&nbsp;» (the "forced labourer of the gramophone").

Les grands magasins Dufayel in Montmartre, originally founded as the «&nbsp;Palais de la Nouveauté&nbsp;» in 1865 but uncer the 
managament of Georges Dufayel (1855-1916) from 1890, were a model of «&nbsp;art nouveau&nbsp;» splendour. In addition to the goods for sale 
it offered a progamme of up-to-date entertainment, including a lighthouse, a conservatory of tropical plants, a «&nbsp;palmarium&nbsp;». 
an ambience of luxury and modernity in which the <i>cinématographe</i> inevitably had its part to play. The film made by Zecca 
for the 1900 Exposition, seems in part at least to have been sponsored by Dufayel and intended for exhibition in the shop's ornate 
theatre. For several years Dufayel would continue to offer «&nbsp;la lumière chantante, dernière découverte présentée avec les 
appareils de la maison Radiguet&nbsp;». Arthur-Honoré Radiguet (1850–1905) of Massiot and Radiguet was an optical ferm engaged 
in a whole gamut of entertainments including electricity, popular science demonstrations, X-rays, photography and latterly cinematography, 
offering, from 1903, a selection of projectors based on the models patented by Ambroise-François Parnaland.

In 1900, with his longtime collaborators, the brothers Ernest and Edgar Normandin, Joly created the Société du Biophonographe, 
energetically exploiting an electric system for synchronising the projection of film with the sound from a phonograph. When the 
brand was offically registered on 27 September, the machines were described as «&nbsp;appareils de chronophotographie et phongraphie 
par un mouvement de synchronisme à l'effet de donner l'illusion complète de la vie&nbsp». Some sound films were made and projected, 
including <i>Vues de Transvaal</i> on 5 July at the Concert de libre échange in Paris, <i>Le Médecin malgré lui</i>, presumably based 
on the 1666 play by Molière, and a short talking playlet, <i>Lolotte</i>. There had been on the eighteenth-century erotic novel, 
<i>Les Joies de Lolotte</i> and a short 1879 vaudeville comedy of teh same name by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy but the film 
borrows from them only the name of the central character. It is a mildly slapstick account of a rowing couple at a hotel. It was 
directed and filmed by the Normandins while Henri Joly himself played the owner of the hotel who gets defenestrated at the end of 
the play and a celebrated imitator from the Casino played a nightingale  (off) - introduced evidently to demonstrate the importance

The Société du Biophonographe rapidly ran into financial difficulties although they battled to keep it going until the last possible 
moment. On July 25 1901, a Paris correspondent of a US paper, <i>The Salt Lake Herald</i> could write of how he had been able "to see 
a private view of a new 'bio-phonograph' invented by Mr. Normandin. This tries to solve the vexed question of combining the biograph 
and the phonograph." the journalist enthused about one view which "showed an Italian tenor, life-size, who went through all the Italian 
gestures of his song, and gave the song at the same time". In fact, however, what is most interesting about Joly and Normandin's experiments 
was their relative lack of interest in gesticulating tenors, marching bands or whistling coons and the other rather obvious musical possibilities

of synchronised sound which had tended to dominate the work of other pioneers in the field such as Gaumont and Messter and their 
attempt rather to foreground its dramatic possibilities.
<br><br>
The article appeared in Utah on 19 August and by 10 October, just two weeks after the registration of the brand, the company was 
dissolved and definitevly declared bankrupt on 28 February 1902. They did not abandon their work for all that. A short synchronised 
film,<i>Une sérénade espagnole, d’O.M</i> was shown in a cinema in Saint Quentin on 17 October 1902 and as late as 14 January 
1905, Joly was patenting yet another «&nbsp;appareil de synchronisme&nbsp;». He succeding in selling to the patent to another man 
with whom he had requently collaborated in the past, Georges Mendel, enabling the latter to progress from a system where the synchronisation 
had relied purely on the dexterity of the operator to his electrically operated Phono-Gramo-Théâtre of 1906, As well as inheriting 
Joly's patent, Mendel would seem also, as the name of his system indicated, the interest in the dramatic as opposed to the musical 
possibilities of synchornised sound.

The German physicist Ernst Walter Rühmer (1878-1913) was a high-powered reaeacher in a number of different fields. His work on light-sensitive 
selenum cells had immesuareby improved the Alexander Bell telephone system (greatly increasing its range), was a pionner in wireless 
telephony and, by 1909, had even produced the first experimental television transmissions. As early as 1900, as part of his optical wireless telephone 
research, Rühmer recorded the fluctuations of the transmitting arc-light as varying shades of light and dark bands onto a continuous roll 
of photographic film. He then perceivedd that he could reverse the process and reproduce the recorded sound from this photographic strip. 
Although he enthused over the invention of what he called the photographophone ("It is truly a wonderful process: sound becomes electricity, 
becomes light, causes chemical actions, becomes light and electricity again, and finally sound."), he was an experimental scientist 
and not a film-maker and di not, at this time, pursue the matter any further, but the principle discovered was the most important 
"missing link" in all the existing stsyems of synchronised sound, for it was in in practice that of "sound on film".
